18.075635,2018,Super Troopers 2,13.5,100,6,2038,20180420,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,  Several years after the first film  the officers have been fired from the Spurbury Police Department after taking Fred Savage on a ride-along that resulted in his death. Farva (Kevin Heffernan) (a fat  loud  ill-tempered  obnoxious  and arrogant radio operator and occasional patrolman) is now a construction supervisor  with Mac (Steve Lemme) (the Trooper who enjoys pranks the most) and Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) (a rookie State Trooper) working for him. Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar) (a veteran of the Vermont State Police who is the second-in-command of his barracks) works in logging  and Foster (Paul Soter) (arguably the most calm and reserved Trooper of the department) is living with his girlfriend and former coworker  Spurbury Police Chief Ursula Hanson (Marisa Coughlan). Mac receives a call from his former boss  Captain O'Hagen (Brian Cox) (the Cantankerous commander of his Vermont State Trooper barracks)  to gather the group and meet for a fishing trip in Canada.Once the group arrives  they find that O'Hagen's intention had been for them to have a meeting with Vermont Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter). She explains that during a recent land survey  it was discovered that land in Canada was originally designated for the US. Canada has agreed to hand over the land  and Gov. Jessman needs to set up a police department to take over from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the region. She invites the group to become state troopers again  with the promise that they will become full-time officers should they succeed at this task.At a reception for the police officers  they meet the town mayor  Guy Le Franc (Rob Lowe) (a former Montreal Canadiens hockey player and the current mayor of a Canadian border town in Quebec) and cultural attache  Genevieve Aubois (Emmanuelle Chriqui) (a French/Canadian cultural attache focused on relations with the U.S.  who is later revealed to be undercover Officer for Ontario Provincial Police). The Americans are received poorly by the townspeople  who wish to remain Canadian. The next day  Foster and Mac accompany the Mounties on their patrol to meet the local townspeople  where they are attacked in Le Franc's strip club. Thorny and Rabbit are tasked with replacing metric road signs with their U.S.-equivalent measurements  and Farva is assigned as the dispatcher.Mounties are Sergeant Christophe Bellefuille (Tyler Labine) (a Patriotically jingoistic Canadian Mountie)  Sergeant Major Roger Archambault (Will Sasso) (an obnoxious Canadian Mountie)  Staff Sergeant Major Henri Podien (Hayes MacArthur) (an arguably calm and reserved Canadian Mountie).Thorny and Rabbit encounter several young children under the influence of drugs. They ask the kids to lead them to where they found the drugs and arrive at an abandoned lake house where they encounter unmarked pills and counterfeit cell phones. The next day  the Canadian Mounties play a prank on the Vermont State Troopers by releasing a bear into their station. In retaliation  the State Troopers kidnap the Mounties and release them in the woods. They then don Mountie uniforms and attempt to discredit their Canadian counterparts by performing pranks on the people they pull over. However  their pranks are cut short when Le Franc reveals that he will use the serious crime of impersonating an officer to keep the territory from becoming American.The State Troopers  realizing that they will not be given their original jobs after failing at this task  intend to return to America. During a botched highway stop  Farva and Mac encounter another cache of drugs and cell phones  as well as assault rifles. The troopers realize that these items are all more valuable in the U.S. than in Canada  and that someone has been planting these items around the town in preparation for the turnover to the U.S  to avoid having to cross the border. Back at the station  Genevieve  who has been flirting with Rabbit  arrives  and the two begin to have sex  only to be attacked and carried-off. The rest of the State Troopers learn about Rabbit's kidnapping by reviewing his dash-cam  and suspect the Canadian Mounties are involved.Using a cellphone Triangulator on the counterfeit phones  the State Troopers arrive at a sawmill. They encounter the Mounties  only to realize the Mounties had suspected the State Troopers as the drug smugglers. Guy Le Franc reveals himself as the leader of the smuggling operation and has captured Genevieve and Rabbit and tied them to a board placed on the saw. Genevieve reveals herself to be a double agent working for Le Franc  and the groups engage in a shootout.The State Troopers and Mounties are successful  and Rabbit is rescued. Le Franc and his employees are arrested  and Genevieve reveals that she is actually Andrea Spooner  and part of the Ontario Provincial Police and is working undercover.\nGov. Jessman arrives to congratulate the officers in their success. At a press conference  the Canadian Mounties congratulate their American counterparts  and give praise for their efforts. Gov. Jessman announces that  due to the hidden contraband  the territory will remain in Canadian control for the time being  causing both nations' officers to insult each other and begin brawling once again.In a mid-credits scene  body-cam footage is shown from the ill-fated ride along with Fred Savage. The police officers have been called to rescue a cat out of a tree. After Fred Savage learns that their job entails them calling the fire department for the rescue  he begins climbing the tree to rescue the cat himself. He falls out of the tree and manages to land safely  only to be hit and killed by the arriving firetruck.In a post-credits scene  Farva blends his Pinky toe into a smoothie and drinks it straight out of the blender  the result of losing a bet with Rabbit during the movie.  , 'The time is meow.'

Army Ranger sniper Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) and his team are attacked by the Predator on a hostage retrieval mission. McKenna incapacitates the Predator and has its armor mailed off. At the behest of government agent Will Traeger (Sterling K. Brown) (Director of the  Stargazer Project  who jails Quinn)  he is captured and held for examination. Traeger also takes the Predator to a lab for experimentation and observation  recruiting evolutionary biologist Casey Bracket (Olivia Munn) to study it. Casey suggests that the Predator DNA is exactly like human DNA. Traeger wants to know if the human DNA is derived from the Predator DNA. They also determine that the Predator\'s ship was am escape pod  so they wonder where the mother ship is. Casey also wants to speak to Quinn  who made first contact with the Predator.The Predator awakes  breaks out of its bonds  kills lab workers  but spares Bracket (not sure but maybe because she got naked) before leaving.\nMeanwhile the armor that Quinn mailed  has reached Quinn\'s autistic son Rory  who has activated the guidance systems and messes with the mother ship controls as it enters the Earth\'s atmosphere. Rory deactivates their cloak and now the alien mother ship is pursued by Air Force jets. The Predator uses a different helmet at the facility to activate his own helmet\'s camera to figure out Rory has it.The mother ship lands and the Predator inside releases a pair of Predator dogs to track the missing equipment  which is with Rory.McKenna is put into a bus with a group of other government captives  including ex-Marine Gaylord  Nebraska  Williams (Trevante Rhodes)  military veterans Coyle (Keegan-Michael Key) and Baxley (Thomas Jane)  helicopter pilot Nettles (Augusto Aguilera)  and Lynch (Alfie Allen)  another ex-Marine. Seeing the Predator escape from the lab firsthand  they take over the bus. Casey tells Mckenna that she saw the Predator escape and that he is looking for his missing armor and weapons.\nTaking Bracket with them  they head over to McKenna\'s estranged wife  Emily (Yvonne Strahovski)  where he expects to find the Predator armor he mailed off. However  McKenna\'s autistic son Rory (Jacob Tremblay) has gone trick-or-treating while wearing this armor in hopes of avoiding detection from bullies.McKenna and the others find his son just in time to stop a pair of Predator Dogs from ambushing the boy. The Predator chases them into a nearby school. They start to give the Predator\'s armor back when another  larger (& mean looking) Predator (Brian A. Prince) arrives and kills the first. They flee  and the second Predator sets out to retrieve the lost technology.Bracket concludes that the Predators are attempting to improve themselves with the DNA of humans and  presumably  other planets\' inhabitants. The team flees to an abandoned barn  but Traeger finds them  captures them  and shares his theory that the Predators anticipate that climate change will end their ability to retrieve human DNA for further hybridization  so they are scrambling to retrieve the best human DNA before it is too late  so that they can adapt to Human DNA and move in when the humans are gone. Traeger also tells Casey that the dead Predator was a rogue and maybe he was bringing some technology to Earth to try and stop the other Predators.\nSeeing Rory drawing a map to the rogue spaceship  Traeger takes the boy away to go to the ship. The team escapes and goes after him with the help of a brain-damaged Predator Dog.When all are at the crashed Predator ship  the second Predator arrives  kills Lynch  and explains through translation software that it will blow up the ship to keep it out of their hands and then give them all a head start before it hunts them down. The Predator quickly kills off most of the team. Traeger tries to use a Predator weapon on the alien but accidentally kills himself in the process.The Predator takes Rory  presumably because his autism reflects an advancement in human evolution and is therefore worthwhile in the Predator hybridization  and flies away in his ship. McKenna  Nebraska  and Nettles land on the ship\'s exterior  but the Predator activates a force field. This slices Nettles\' legs off  and he falls off of the ship to his death. Nebraska sacrifices himself and slides into the ship\'s turbine  causing it to crash. McKenna sneaks into the ship as it crashes and attacks the Predator. After the crash  Bracket arrives  and the three overpower and kill it. They pay their respects to their fallen comrades with trinkets representing each one before heading off.After these events  McKenna and Rory are seen in a science lab watching the opening of cargo found on the Predator\'s ship. A piece of technology floats out and attaches itself to a lab worker  working to transform him into a  Predator killer  suit before deactivating.' ,  You'll never see him coming.

She also gives them the blueprints for the heist.Alice goes to an auction to get a van and ends up paying more money than it's worth. To make things more difficult  Alice tells Veronica she can't drive  so Veronica plans to recruit Harry's old driver Bash (Garrett Dillahunt). Alice then goes to get guns and has a woman help her buy guns since she doesn't have the proper documents to purchase firearms. At the same time  Linda attempts to figure out the blueprints to the heist  but she can't make out the word on the paper. She visits a man whose house she believes to be the mark by posing as someone working for a company that owns the house  but she slips up when she mentions the man's wife  whom he says has been dead for four months. Linda breaks down when she mentions her dead husband. She and the man start kissing before Linda realizes it's wrong and she leaves. Linda later joins Alice as the two go to a shooting range to practice. Alice does well  but Linda turns out to be a lousy shot.Alice joins the escort site and starts seeing a man named David (Lukas Haas). He turns out to be a real estate executive and spots the blueprints in Alice's room  which he identifies as being part of the Mulligan home.Veronica finally meets with Amanda in a diner. She mentions not being able to meet with Veronica previously due to taking care of her newborn baby. Because of this  Veronica chooses not to mention anything involving the heist.One week before the heist is to take place  the Mannings visit Bash and murder him. Veronica finds out and tells the ladies that they need a new driver. Linda notices how fast Belle is  so she invites her to join the heist. Despite Veronica's initial reservations  she agrees to let Belle join due to her take-no-shit attitude.Veronica visits Jack to ask for help with Jamal  though he tells her there's nothing he can do  and that he learned from his father and Harry that you reap what you sow. While Veronica talks to Jack  the other ladies scope out the outside area to get a view of the external security. They also spend time at the hideout practicing how they will move the money around and how fast they need to move.Veronica goes to Amanda's apartment with Olivia to talk to her  but she is held up by her baby. Olivia then goes to a nearby closet and starts barking. Veronica looks over on the table and sees a flask...which looks just like the one that belonged to Harry. Veronica walks over to the door  wanting to open it and not have what she's thinking confirmed  but she grabs Olivia and leaves before Amanda comes back out. Amanda goes to the closet and speaks to the man inside...and it's HARRY. Veronica drives away feeling overwhelmed.A flashback then shows how Harry set up his guys with a decoy in the driver's seat  and he fired two shots to get the police to fire at the van just before he set off explosives to obliterate his men. Next we see Hary on a boat with Jack  as they have been working together  and Jack had ordered Harry to steal from Jamal. Another flashback shows how strained things got between Veronica and Harry just before the last heist took place. We then see back to 2008 when Marcus was driving and did an illegal U-turn to go back home and deliver something to Harry. He was pulled over by a cop and almost quickly shot to death when Marcus failed to show his hands. This broke Harry and left him desperate.Tom meets with Jack over Jack firing the campaign manager that's been with their family for thirty years. Tom curses Jack out and orders him to have Siobhan rehire the man  but Jack tells him that he can't wait for the day that he doesn't have to talk to him anymore since Tom won't be there.Just before the heist takes place  Veronica finds Ken (Matt Walsh)  the CEO of the Mulligans' security company  and the man in the lewd photos she acquired earlier. They are of him with his niece. With her putting him in a corner  Ken gives Veronica the codes to the Mulligans' safe.The ladies then gather for the heist later that evening. Belle distracts the security guards outside by firing flares into nearby cars. Veronica  Linda  and Alice get inside with masks and devices that disguise their voices. They make it to the safe and take all of the money  but just as they head out  Tom emerges from his room with his gun and orders the women to drop theirs. He unmasks Veronica and shoots Alice in the shoulder  wounding her  but Linda shoots and kills Tom. The ladies run out of the house and head to the van  only to find Belle held at gunpoint by Jatemme  who was sent by Jamal to take ALL the money. Jatemme hijacks the van  but the ladies give chase and ram the back of the van  causing Jatemme to crash and die. Linda then takes Alice to the hospital to get treated for her wound.Veronica goes back to the hideout and finds Harry there. She breaks down  angry over his betrayal. He attempts to justify what he did as him having to look out for himself and his new family (Amanda and their baby). Harry turns to kill Veronica  but she shoots him dead first with the gun that Linda used to kill Tom. Veronica leaves the gun in Harry's hand and leaves with the money.Later on  it's heard that Jack won the election by way of sympathy votes for Tom's death. Breechelle then goes into her salon and finds a bag of money left behind by Belle. She is outside with Bailee as they drive off to start a new life together. Alice is now planning to start her own business  while Linda is able to buy back the shop with her kids.In the final scene  Alice goes to a diner to meet a friend  and she sees Veronica sitting at a nearby table. A man then enters and sits with Veronica. She gives him a large sum of her share of the money to the man so that he can help build a library  and she requests that it be named after Marcus. Afterwards  Veronica follows Alice outside and greets her warmly.  , 'Left with nothing. Capable of anything.'

Patriarch Maverick (Russell Hornsby) gives his three children instructions on what to do in the event that he or they are ever pulled over by police  but to also not be ashamed of their identities as black children. Maverick then hands them Black Panther ten step programs.Present Day in the early 2010sStarr (Amandla Stenberg) is Maverick\'s daughter who lives with him  her mother Lisa (Regina Hall)  her older half-brother Seven (Lamar Johnson) and younger brother Sekani (TJ Wright). Maverick was once part of the most violent gang in the neighborhood  the King Lords  but he has since left that life behind. The Carters live in the mostly poor  predominantly black neighborhood of Garden Heights. While gang violence is prevalent  there are places like Maverick\'s grocery store and other shops that thrive.Starr attends Williamson  a prep school in a rich  mostly white area. Starr feels that she can\'t be  too ghetto  with her Williamson friends  but not  too preppy  around her Garden Heights friends. She is dating Chris (KJ Apa)  who just recently tried to have sex with Starr when she wasn\'t ready. He comes to her at school to apologize and show off his corny dance moves. Starr acknowledges that she and Chris get looks from the white girls who are too scared to say anything due to their interracial relationship.Starr attends a party in Garden Heights with Seven\'s sister Kenya (Dominique Fishback)  whom Starr sometimes can\'t stand. Kenya notices a girl outside who\'s been talking trash about her  so she expects Starr to back her up in a fight  but Starr refuses to get involved. Starr strays from Kenya and meets up with her childhood best friend Khalil (Algee Smith). The two chat for a while until they witness an altercation between a group of guys  followed by the sounds of gunshots. Everybody runs out of the house  and Starr gets into Khalil\'s car.Khalil drives Starr home as the two listen to a Tupac song. Khalil points out a famous saying of the late rapper -  The hate u give little infants fucks everybody  (which becomes an acronym for THUG LIFE). The two pull over and start to reminisce about their childhood with another friend named Natasha who is no longer with them. They talk about playing with  Harry Potter  wands and how Khalil was Starr\'s first kiss. He kisses her in the car  but she tells him she has a boyfriend. Khalil pulls out to drive again. But a short while later  they are pulled over by the police. The cop  Officer Mackintosh  AKA 115 (Drew Starkey) (nicknamed due to his badge number) exits his squad car. He tells Khalil he pulled him over for failing to signal a lane change and asks for his license and registration  but Khalil argues over the matter even as Starr  who has her hands on the dashboard  tells him to comply. 115 orders Khalil to step out of the vehicle as he runs his license. Khalil looks into his car to see if Starr is okay  but she keeps telling him to do what the officer says. Then for some reason  Khalil reaches into his car to take out a hairbrush  and 115  mistaking it for a weapon  opens fire on Khalil. Starr runs out of the car to Khalil\'s side  but 115 cuffs her. He quickly realizes Khalil didn\'t have a weapon in his hand and he frantically calls for an ambulance. Starr weeps as Khalil slowly dies by her side.Starr is brought in for questioning by two detectives with her mother by her side. They ask questions regarding Khalil potentially carrying drugs and not about the incident in question. Starr\'s uncle Carlos (Common)  another officer  comes in and takes her and Lisa out of the room. Starr is left traumatized and haunted by the incident even days later  and she cannot bring herself to tell anyone at school about it.Starr attends a wake at Khalil\'s home where she gives her condolences to his grandmother  Miss Rosalie (Rhonda Johnson Dents)  who tells Starr that she was the only real friend Khalil ever had. She also confides to Starr that Khalil was selling drugs for King (Anthony Mackie)  leader of the King Lords. After the wake  Maverick and Carlos argue over whether or not 115 will be investigated for killing Khalil.The Carters attend Khalil\'s funeral at a church. Seven\'s biological mother Iesha (Karan Kendrick) loudly orders him to join her  King  and his siblings in the back over the sound of the choir. Seven doesn\'t want to go  but Lisa tells him to just do it. A lawyer  April Ofrah (Issa Rae)  goes up to give a speech on how what happened to Khalil has happened to too many young unarmed black teens that are being killed by the police all over the country at an alarming rate. She also implies that she knows that Starr was the witness to Khalil\'s shooting  even though that information had not been disclosed to the public.April visits the Carters that evening to offer Starr a chance to do an interview regarding the incident. She appears hesitant  and April says it\'s okay if she chooses not to. Before April leaves  Starr brings up what happened to Natasha. They were playing with Khalil as kids until a King Lord shot Natasha dead in the streets. Starr was afraid to snitch on him because she feared he or the other King Lords may retaliate. She later found out months afterwards that the shooter was killed in an unrelated rival gang hit  but she still didn\'t speak up  and she has felt guilty ever since. April tells her not to feel guilty and says that this is her chance to get justice for Khalil.Starr\'s parents take her to the interview where her face is blurred out and her voice is distorted. She tells the interviewer that Khalil was working for the King Lords  which King sees on TV.Later  as the Carters are having dinner  Starr and Maverick see King and his goons standing outside threateningly. Maverick goes outside to deal with King  who knows that Starr mentioned him in the interview. This leads to an altercation that is broken up just as the police arrive and two officers approach. Maverick calmly complies with the cops until one officer  a black man  presses Maverick against the window in front of his family. Lisa runs out to hand the cops his ID  but it gets more heated when the white cop presses Seven for his ID. Starr and another woman record the confrontation on their phone to show how the cops treat black folks  and the cops back off and leave the family alone. However  little Sekani is shaken up by it. When the family returns home  Starr tearfully apologizes for getting King to go after them. Maverick stands his kids outside the house and tells them to recite a step from the program he gave them earlier  which is to have something to live and die for  and for Maverick  that\'s his whole family.The stress from the incident puts more of a strain on Starr\'s life at school. The other kids use Khalil\'s death as an excuse to get out of class to make it look like they care and are trying to protest. Starr grows more distant from Chris  and things go sour with her friends Hailey (Sabrina Carpenter) and Maya (Megan Lawless) when they watch a news report on how 115 and his family have been getting death threats for shooting Khalil  and Hailey shows more empathy for 115 than for Khalil. When Starr talks to her mom about this  Lisa tells her that she has always been following Hailey\'s word without thinking for herself.On prom night  Starr attends with Chris  but all the other kids are looking at her weird. He takes her into his limo and says that he knows Starr was the witness to Khalil\'s death  and he is upset that she kept that from him. Starr feels that Chris doesn\'t grasp how the situation is for her as a black girl  and that he appears to ignore her identity as a black girl. Chris argues against that  saying that he sees her for who she really is.After they reconcile  Chris takes Starr and Seven home so that he can meet Maverick. The meeting turns out poorly  because although Lisa is happy to meet Chris  Maverick is none too pleased to see that Starr is dating a white boy. After Chris leaves  Maverick tells Starr he feels he has failed to show her what a black man should be  and Starr says that he showed her what a man should  period. As the family embraces  gunshots fly through the house  sent by King\'s goons. Maverick brings the family to Carlos\'s house to stay for safety  but he and Seven go back to stand guard at the house in case King comes back  despite Lisa\'s protests for neither of them to go back.Starr later goes before a grand jury to give her testimony against 115  and to tell everyone of the type of person that Khalil really was.At school  Hailey confronts Starr and asks her when she will get over Khalil\'s death. Starr has had enough  and she counters that Hailey is only ever friendly with her because she views Starr as a non-threatening black girl  which Hailey confirms. She also tells Starr that due to Khalil\'s history as a drug dealer  he would have probably gotten killed anyway  and that it made sense for the officer to mistake his hairbrush as a weapon. Starr then grabs Hailey\'s hairbrush from her backpack and starts yelling at her while holding the brush like a weapon  which drives Hailey to tears. Starr tells her that she now knows what it feels like for black folks.Chris drives Starr home  but they start to see a group of black folks protesting toward City Hall. Starr and Chris look at their phones and learn that 115 was not indicted for Khalil\'s death. Starr then gets a text from Kenya to go pick up Seven because King has beaten him up.Starr and Chris arrive at King\'s house where Kenya and her little sister Lyric are tending to Seven\'s wounds. Iesha callously tells the kids to beat it since King is coming back soon and she is just trying to drink. The kids head out the front door but see King arriving in his car. Iesha sends the kids out the back door for safety.The group arrives near City Hall where a massive crowd is growing for the protest. As they approach City Hall  the crowd is halted by a SWAT team. Starr tells Chris to get Kenya and Lyric out of there for safety. She then spots April  who hands her a megaphone so that Starr can be heard. Starr stands high up and announces to the crowd that she was the witness to Khalil\'s death  but so is everyone else in the crowd. While the people are moved  the police start firing tear gas grenades. Starr picks one up and hurls it back toward them. Starr and Seven run out but are blinded by the gas. Two friends of Maverick find the kids and put them in their pickup  along with two others. Starr tells them to go to her father\'s store to get milk to soothe the tear gas burns.The men bring Starr and Seven to Maverick\'s shop to pour milk over their faces. The men leave Starr and Seven  which King sees. As Starr listens to messages from her mother  King\'s goon lights the store on fire. Starr and Seven try to escape out the backdoor  but it\'s locked. Two other shop owners see the fire and try to help get the backdoor open. Maverick  Lisa  and Sekani arrive  and Maverick gets his kids out. King sees this and runs toward them. Maverick threatens to kill King and reaches into his back for the gun  only to find Sekani holding it and aiming it at King. That\'s when two white cops arrive and draw their guns on Sekani  to the horror of everyone else. Starr stands with her hands in the air to protect her little brother and yells to the cops asking how many more of them have to die for them to understand. Sekani drops the gun  and the police turn theirs away from him. King leaves the Carters alone.King is later arrested after multiple testimonies  and his rule over the neighborhood is now over. Starr and Chris are on better terms and are stronger than ever. She is no longer friends with Hailey  but she is still friends with Maya. Seven graduates from high school and is set to go to college the next year. Maverick\'s shop is in the process of being rebuilt  and he and Carlos get along better now.Starr goes to Khalil\'s home where Miss Rosalie tells Starr she can take whatever she wants from Khalil\'s room. She goes in and finds the  Harry Potter  wands that they used to play with. With her closing words  Starr vows to live up to her namesake and light up the darkness.' , 'Two worlds  one voice  no going back'

As the stage is set  running to the front is the legendary rock star  Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek).In a flashback to 1970  Freddie is seen working as a baggage handler at London\'s Heathrow Airport. He lives with his parents Jer (Meneka Das) and Bomi (Ace Bhatti)  and sister Kashmira (Priya Blackburn)  and lives as Farrokh Bulsara  but he prefers to be called Freddie.Freddie attends a show at a club to see a band called \'Smile\' perform. After the show  members Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) are told by their front man Tim Staffell (Jack Roth) tells them that he wants out of the band to pursue bigger opportunities. As he looks for the band  Freddie meets Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and compliments her scarf  which she says is from the store she works at. Freddie then approaches Brian and Roger after the show to compliment their performance and offer to be their new singer. They seem unconvinced at first  especially with Freddie\'s large teeth  but Freddie sings for a moment to show off what he can do.Freddie joins Brian and Roger  along with their new bassist John Deacon  or  Deaky  (Joseph Mazzello). Someone in the audience comments on Tim\'s absence and replacement with a  paki . After a bit of an awkward start  Freddie shows off his talent  despite singing some of the lyrics a bit incorrectly.A year later  the band is getting steady work performing gigs across England  and Freddie has been dating Mary. After their van breaks down  Freddie proposes that they sell it to record their first album  and they start to go by the band name \'Queen\'.Mary and the guys have lunch at Freddie\'s home  joined by Mary\'s deaf father. Jer tells the guests how their family were originally from Zanzibar until they were chased out of there. Freddie then answers the phone and tells the guys that a music manager named John Reid (Aiden Gillen)  who works with Elton John  has listened to their demo and wants to meet and manage Queen  to the excitement of the other guys.The band meets with Reid  who introduces them to Paul Prenter (Allen Leech)  another manager. Reid gets the band to go on a popular BBC show to perform  Killer Queen   but they initially clash with the show\'s producers for wanting them to perform the way the network wants them to (mainly lip-syncing the song).1975At home  Freddie proposes to Mary  who accepts. The other guys come in to tell Freddie that Reid has booked the band a tour of America. The band embarks on their U.S. tour to ecstatic sold-out concerts. They also hire lawyer Jim Beach (Tom Hollander)  or  Miami  as Freddie prefers. The band  plus Reid and Beach  meet with EMI\'s record producer Ray Foster (Mike Myers) to make their next album. Freddie proposes something similar to an experience of going to the opera  and so he wants to call it  A Night at the Opera. The band stays together as they work toward their next big hit. While trying to write new songs  Paul approaches Freddie and kisses him. Although he doesn\'t try to resist  Freddie tries to make it seem like he doesn\'t feel somewhat similarly toward Paul  who claims he knows Freddie as well as he knows himself.Despite some disagreements  the band comes to create  Bohemian Rhapsody . They play it for Foster  who thinks it\'s too long at six minutes and is comprised of nonsense words. He would rather use Roger\'s  I\'m in Love With My Car  or  You\'re My Best Friend  to be the main single on the album over  Bohemian Rhapsody   since he thinks those songs would play better with a young demographic while no radio station will want to play a long song. Queen decide to turn their backs on Foster and EMI. Freddie takes  Bohemian Rhapsody  to DJ Kenny Everett (Dickie Beau) to play it for the very first time to the public. It receives mixed to outright scathing reviews  but it becomes one of the band\'s biggest hits that they play at venues all over the world.After the world tour  Freddie meets with Mary  whom he had been distancing himself from on the road. He comes out to Mary as bisexual  but she tells him she thinks he\'s gay. She starts to cry as she is tired of all of Freddie\'s excuses  and she breaks up with him.1980Freddie cuts his hair short and sports his now famous mustache. He owns his own home next to Mary  but he appears to be lonely. He calls Paul to arrange a party and invite a bunch of strangers. Freddie invites the band  but he starts to behave all crass and rudely toward them  prompting them to leave. After the party  Freddie gropes a waiter  Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker). Although he offends Jim  Freddie apologizes and invites him to stay. The two chat and share a kiss before Jim leaves  but he invites Freddie to find him after he\'s found himself.Brian comes up with a new song that he thinks will encourage the audience to perform along with the band -  We Will Rock You . Sure enough  it becomes another smash hit. After one of Queen\'s performances  Paul approaches Reid and suggests that they try and get Freddie to go solo. Meanwhile  Freddie finds Mary with her new boyfriend David (Max Bennett). On the way home from the show  Reid offers the solo deal to Freddie  but it only enrages him to even think about leaving the band  and Freddie fires Reid.Freddie\'s behavior gets worse as he shows up to rehearsals late and almost fights with Roger. However  for all that rancor  the band remains productive: they settle their arguments as Deaky creates a catchy new bass line that inspires a new hit   Another One Bites The Dust .The band goes to a press conference where reporters hound Freddie with questions about his sex life and orientation  due to ongoing rumors that he has been engaging in gay orgies. He appears too overwhelmed and dazed to properly answer questions when he is not being rude to the reporters.Queen then does a video for  I Want To Break Free   which gets banned by MTV for featuring the group in drag. Later  Freddie tries to get in touch with Jim  but finds that there are a large number of Jim Huttons in the phone book.Freddie later confesses to the others that he signed a $4 million solo contract with CBS Records  which deeply upsets the others. As Freddie leaves  Brian tells Freddie that he needs them more than he realizes.1984Freddie moves to Munich  West Germany to record his solo album   Mr. Bad Guy . One night  he is visited by Mary  who says she is pregnant. She tries to convince Freddie to rejoin the band as they have been offered a spot to perform at the Live Aid benefit concert for Africa. Mary leaves  but Freddie confronts Paul about not telling him about Live Aid. He breaks up with Paul and demands that he never see him again. In retaliation  Paul goes on TV to discuss his sexual relations with Freddie.Freddie gets in touch with Beach and manages to get the others together to discuss joining Live Aid. He apologizes to the guys for his behavior and abandoning them. Beach tells them that the lineup is fully booked  but he talks to Bob Geldof and convinces him to let them perform  and they all agree under the condition that anything they come up with be credited to Queen as a whole and not to any individual one of them.The band starts to practice for the show  but Freddie falls ill. He sees a doctor and gets the diagnosis that he tested positive for AIDS. Freddie tells the band about it  but he doesn\'t want them to feel bad for him as long as they can continue to perform together as friends. They all then get together for a group hug.1985The day of Live Aid has arrived. Freddie finds Jim and invites him to come see the show. He visits his family and shows them love before heading to the performance. Bomi decides he will want to watch the show on TV with his family. While at the show  Mary and David arrive  and Jim joins them backstage to watch the show.It is now Queen\'s turn to perform. They start with  Bohemian Rhapsody   where Freddie blows a kiss to the camera for his family. The next song is  Radio Ga Ga   followed by  Hammer To Fall   and finally  We Are The Champions   where people watching everywhere sing along to. Numerous calls for pledges come in  bringing in over ??1 million  and Queen\'s performance is so epic that it drives many viewers to tears. After the performance  the guys walk away like true champions.The final text states that Freddie Mercury died in 1991 from AIDS-related pneumonia at age 45. He was in a relationship with Jim Hutton for the rest of his life  and he remained good friends with Mary Austin until his death. Jim Beach and the surviving members of Queen joined to create the Mercury Phoenix Trust to help fight AIDS worldwide.' , 'Fearless lives forever'  'The only thing more extraordinary than their music is his story'   The music you know  the story you don't

Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and Vince (Barry Pepper) attempt to board the train while Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar) fend off WCKD mercenaries. Thomas and Vince hop on and separate the cart with the captives away from the main train. When the villains realize what happened  they try to run back to kill the Gladers. Fortunately  Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and some members of The Right Hand were hiding nearby  and they hijack a WCKD jet and manage to carry the cart off the train and back to their hideout.Upon arriving at the hideout  Thomas discovers that Minho isn't with the ones they rescued as he had believed. Newt and Frypan opt to go with Thomas to go find him  even though Vince and Jorge want everyone to stay together.Janson (Aiden Gillen) finds Minho at the train site. When they bring him back to WCKD headquarters  Minho is put in a virtual reality simulation where he finds himself in the same maze he started in. He runs through it and finds himself being chased by a Griever. Minho is cornered by the Griever in the simulation while WCKD scientists are extracting his blood for finding a cure for the Flare virus. Overseeing all of this is Ava (Patricia Clarkson) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario)  the latter who feels remorse for betraying Thomas and the others at the end of the previous film.Meanwhile  Thomas  Newt  and Frypan drive through a tunnel past an infection checkpoint where they encounter Cranks. Their car flips over and nearly traps them  but Frypan emerges with a rifle to start shooting at the Cranks before they can attack. An even larger number of Cranks approach before the guys are saved by Jorge and Brenda. They proceed toward the Last City until they notice it is guarded by a massive wall to keep the infected out.Ava and Teresa meet with WCKD board members to discuss the matter of the wall and their progress in creating a serum for the virus. Ava requests that they allow her and the scientists to begin performing trials. Despite their hesitation  Teresa steps in and gives good reasoning for going ahead with the trials.The group arrives outside the city to see a crowd of infected protesters gathered by the wall. Within moments  guards start to fire upon the protesters using enormous blasters. Thomas and his friends run from the chaos and are taken by masked men. After being brought to a safe spot  Jorge starts beating one of the masked men. The man reveals himself to be Gally (Will Poulter)  previously thought to have been dead. Thomas punches him in the face as payback for Gally killing Chuck. Gally apologizes for what he did as he had been infected at the time. He offers the group a chance to help them.Gally leads the group to the home of an infected rebellion leader named Lawrence (Walton Goggins)  whose face is disfigured as a result of the virus. Lawrence offers Thomas a way to sneak into the city on the condition that he helps him out as well. Thomas agrees and travels through a secret passage with Newt and Gally while the others stay behind.At a lab  Teresa tests out Minho's blood on a young infected girl named Cheyenne (Shai Lun Choo). Teresa then goes to Minho's cell to tell him what she's doing. He pulls her in and attacks her for being a traitor before guards come in to sedate him. Teresa goes back to find that Cheyenne's condition has worsened  as she is now in a Crank-like state.At the hideout  Gally shows Thomas and Newt that their only way into the WCKD facility is through Teresa. Thomas is hesitant in going through with it  which Newt thinks is because Thomas still has feelings for Teresa. Newt gets angry with Thomas until he gets calmed down. Outside  Newt reveals to Thomas that he got infected in the tunnels  but he doesn't want anyone else to know about it just yet.Thomas manages to get Teresa to spot him on the streets  leading her to follow him into an alley where Gally captures her. She is brought before the group to convince her that they need to get inside the facility  and Teresa says they need her fingerprint.Thomas  Newt  Gally  and Teresa all head toward the facility. Gally goes to find a serum and the immune children while the others go look for Minho. They find and finally free him  and they head to escape  but are found by Janson and several guards. Teresa helps the guys escape while she stays behind. Newt finds the children and frees them  with Gally guiding them outside after finding the serum. The children head toward a bus with Brenda. Frypan helps pull the bus away with a crane  but it becomes too heavy and falls away from WCKD. Thomas  Newt  and Minho are forced to jump out a window and into a pool to get away from Janson.Lawrence gathers his army of infected people as they head to take the city back. Lawrence rides a van with explosives into the side of the wall  causing a huge explosion that allows the army to storm in. Soon  the whole city is under siege. Meanwhile  Newt starts to get worse  turning more into a Crank. He gives Thomas a necklace with a cylinder before he passes out. Teresa broadcasts her voice over the speakers to call to Thomas  saying they need his blood for the cure since it was his blood that helped cure Brenda when she was sick. Moments later  Newt reawakens in a Crank-like state  begging Thomas to kill him as he starts to attack. Thomas defends himself against Newt until he is forced to put a knife in Newt's heart.

The film opens with him writing down his thoughts in a journal  which he plans to keep for a year  and then destroy. He leads a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. It faces dwindling attendance under Toller\'s leadership  which has taken the church away from its historical focus on Calvinist theology; it now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller  a former military chaplain  is also struggling with the death of his son Joseph  who was killed in the Iraq War  and with alcoholism. Toller seeks a deeper spiritual understanding through reading Roman Catholic writers (G. K. Chesterton and Thomas Merton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life  the evangelical megachurch in Albany that owns First Reformed.He is approached by Mary  who is seeking counseling for Michael  her radical-environmentalist husband. Michael further challenges Toller\'s beliefs: he explains that he wants Mary to get an abortion  because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by climate change. Mary finds a suicide vest belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it  promising to counsel Michael about it. Mary and Toller discuss going to the police  but Toller feels it would worsen Michael\'s state. Just before their next appointment  Michael sends Toller a text message asking to meet in a local park. Toller arrives to find Michael dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael\'s will and testament  a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump  where his ashes are scattered.Meanwhile  plans are underway to celebrate the 250th anniversary of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor  the governor  and Edward Balq  one of Abundant Life\'s key financial backers and the owner of a polluting factory. At a meeting in a diner  Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael\'s will and deems it a political act  and the two argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as  complicated   but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian stewardship.Experiencing physical pain  Toller reluctantly sees a doctor  who suspects stomach cancer and schedules some tests. Toller has Michael\'s laptop computer  which he took after Michael\'s suicide to prevent the police from discovering Michael\'s radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael\'s concerns  including the materials on Balq\'s factory which inspired him to make the explosive vest. One night  Mary visits Toller in the parsonage of the church  and he plays Michael\'s role in a nonsexual rite of physical intimacy that the couple used to perform.Toller begs Mary not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony  he puts on the explosive vest  and arms it. When he sees Mary entering for the ceremony  he removes the vest and instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his alb. Toller pours a glass full of drain cleaner and is about to drink it when Mary interrupts him. The two embrace  kissing passionately before the film abruptly cuts to black.

With his behavior getting alarming  David goes to see a drug rehab counselor  who says their program has an eighty percent success rate. David enters Nic into the program  and the two hug and exchange the word  everything  to each other.After some time in rehab  Nic tells David and Karen that he wants to stay on at the rehab center\'s extension program  a halfway house  and not go to college right away. Later  David gets a call that Nic has not returned to the halfway home. He angrily wants to know why no one is looking for Nic  but is told that their job at that point is not to locate him  but they will be there if he should return. They say relapse is part of recovery. David takes it upon himself to find Nic  eventually locating him in an alley in the rain. Nic vomits inside David\'s car  and David enters him back into rehab. When he and Karen bring him back  he demands to know the full extent of Nic\'s drug habits  learning just how many drugs his son is using.Later on  Nic is doing better and tells his dad he wants to go to college. David is excited and drops Nic off at school. Again  they exchange  everything s. It goes well at first  and Nic even starts dating a classmate. While at Thanksgiving at his girlfriend\'s  Nic finds pills in their bathroom and takes them. He begins doing hard drugs again at school  his relationship falling apart. When he next comes back home  he asks if he can borrow David\'s car in order to go to a narcotics anonymous meeting. Instead  he goes out and scores. The next morning  when the two young children get into a fight because Jasper thinks Daisy stole the money out of his piggy bank  David confronts Nic asking if he stole the money. Nic gets aggressive and denies it  but David realizes he\'s using again. David says he shouldn\'t have let Nic go to school  he wasn\'t ready - but Nic refuses any more treatment and runs away.Caught up to the beginning of the film  Dr. Brown explains that crystal meth is extremely addictive  and that no matter what number he was told  the likelihood of someone overcoming an addiction is closer to eight percent. While searching for Nic  David goes through intense experiences - buying and using cocaine to try to understand his son\'s experience  and meeting and buying a meal for a young addict girl for some insight. Finally  he hears from Nic  but when they meet  Nic is erratic and high  and says he\'s clean but needs a few hundred dollars. David refuses to give him money and tries to get him to come home with him  but Nic flees  completely irrational and unreasonable.Later  David receives a call from a hospital in New York telling him Nic has overdosed. David flies to New York only to find Nic checked himself out against doctor\'s orders  but as he is on his way to fly back to San Francisco  he hears from Nic. He meets him at a diner  and Nic tells him he wants to get clean. In a flashback to when David first sent Nic to stay with his mother for the summer  we learn where  everything  came from - when Nic was sad to leave  his father assured him he loved him more than everything in the world  and they repeated it back to each other.David speaks with Vicki  and they decide Nic will go to Los Angeles to live with her and continue treatment there. Nic is very successful - he graduates college  has a good relationship with his sponsor  Spencer (Andre Royo)  and is fourteen months sober. Around this time  he drives down to San Francisco for a visit with David and Karen. He gets along well with his younger siblings  but when he returns late from an NA meeting  David makes him pee in a cup for drug testing. Nic understands why  even though he promises he\'s clean. After he leaves his dad\'s house  Nic grows anxious and uneasy. He calls Spencer telling him he\'s having a hard time. Spencer insists he come over for dinner that night  but instead  Nic goes downtown and runs into his old friend from rehab Lauren (Kaitlyn Dever). The two score hard drugs together  take them  and have sex.Vicki calls David and tells her that Nic is missing. The two begin blaming each other and have a screaming match on the phone. David once again packs a bag to look for Nic  but Karen tells him she needs him to stay home. When David says he needs to make Nic better  Karen shouts at him that he can\'t - he can\'t fix this. Later  while his family is out  Nic and Lauren break into their house. When the family returns home  they flee out the back  but Nic\'s brother spots them. David and Karen go in different directions  and when Nic takes off in his car  Karen gets into her car and chases after them for miles. She eventually loses them and breaks down crying.When Lauren overdoses  Nic calls an ambulance  and though the EMTs are able to save her  he is left alone. He calls David  and tearfully begs to come home  he doesn\'t want to go to rehab but is willing to come home. David stays firm and tells him he can\'t do that; he can\'t take care of him; Nic needs to call his sponsor and take care of himself. He wishes his son luck and lets him go. Time passes  and Nic is still missing. Vicki calls and begs David for help finding Nic  but David can\'t do anything anymore. Vicki is sure he will be dead soon if they don\'t do anything  but David has to distance himself.David and Karen begin attending al-anon meetings to deal with their situation. Nic overdoses again  nearly dying. David comes to the hospital to see him. He takes Nic  who is very weak  on a walk outside  and the two sit on a bench together. Nic collapses in his father\'s arms  hugging him tightly. David rubs his back as the two look to an uncertain future.The post-script tells us that though it is a constant struggle  Nic has been sober for eight years.' , 'A true story of addiction  survival and family.'

A radical group called  The Left Eye  opposes WorryFree by holding protests and vandalizing their ads.\nCassius  Cash  Green (Lakeith Stanfield) lives in his uncle\'s garage with his girlfriend  Detroit (Tessa Thompson)  an artist and Left Eye member. Struggling to pay rent  Cash gets a job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble talking to customers until an older co-worker  Langston (Danny Glover)  teaches Cash to use his  white voice . Cash uses the voice to excel at work  and his manager says Cash is close to becoming one of RegalView\'s elusive  Power Callers .At the same time  RegalView co-worker Squeeze (Steven Yeun) decides to form a telemarketer\'s union and recruits Cash  Detroit  and their friend Sal (Jermaine Fowler). When Cash participates in a protest at work  he expects to be fired but is instead promoted (as he has qualified to be a power caller). Now in the luxurious Power Caller suite  Cash is told to always use his white voice and learns that RegalView secretly sells arms and human labor from WorryFree.\nCash is uncomfortable with the job until he is shown his new salary. As a Power Caller  Cash is able to afford a new car and apartment and pays off his uncle\'s (Terry Crews) home. Working long hours  he stops participating in the union  and his relationship with Detroit deteriorates. Cash even ends up crossing the union\'s picket line  and one of the picketers hits Cash with a can of soda (yelling  have a cola and smile  woman! ). The video quickly becomes an internet meme.\nContinuing to close sales as a Power Caller  Cash is invited to a party with Steve Lift (Armie Hammer)  CEO of WorryFree. Lift is seemingly fascinated with Cash and invites him to a one-on-one meeting. There  Lift offers Cash a powdered substance which Cash inhales. Looking for the bathroom  Cash instead discovers a shackled half-horse  half-human hybrid who begs him for help.Cash drops his phone in fear and runs into Lift  who explains that WorryFree is planning to make their workers stronger and more obedient by transforming them into  Equisapiens . The transformation takes place when a human snorts a gene-modifying powder similar to cocaine. Cash immediately assumes he just snorted the substance  but Lift assures him he would not do so without Cash\'s consent.\nLift explains he wants Cash to become an Equisapien and act as a false revolutionary figure among them to keep them in line with WorryFree\'s goals  offering Cash $100 million for five years. When the five years are up  Lift says he will be able to take a  defusing powder  and return to his normal self.\nCash leaves in a panic  still worried he was tricked into snorting the powder. He visits Detroit  who tells him she got a video message from Cash\'s missing phone. It turns out to be a cry for help from the Equisapiens. To make the video viral  Cash goes on a reality show called I Got the Shit Kicked Out of Me! (using his newfound status as a meme)  enduring a variety of physical punishments in order to get the video played.The plan backfires; Lift\'s plot is hailed as a ground-breaking scientific advancement  and WorryFree\'s stock reaches an all-time high. A regretful Cash apologizes to Squeeze  Sal  and Detroit. The union decides to make one last stand against RegalView  now joined by Cash.\nThe next day  Cash uses a security code from the Equisapiens video to break into Lift\'s home. He goes to the picket line  where the police show up and start a riot. Cash is knocked out by an officer. Later that night  he wakes up in a police wagon and witnesses the Equisapiens fighting the police  easily overpowering them with their superior strength. The Equisapiens save Cash  thanking him for his help earlier  and run off to keep fighting.\nDetroit and Cash reconcile and everything seemingly returns to normal-until Cash starts to grow horse nostrils. In a mid-credit scene  a fully transformed Cash leads a mob of Equisapiens to Lift\'s house. Cash calls over the intercom and remarks  sorry to bother you  before leading the mob to break down the door.' ,nan

He is kind and warm and loves her deeply.Tish goes to the prison where Fonny is incarcerated to tell him that she's having a baby. Both of them are thrilled  the circumstances non-withstanding. Tish goes home sees her mother Sharon (Regina King). Sharon asks how Fonny is doing - he's in jail after being falsely identified in a rape case and is currently on trial. Tish nervously tell Sharon she is pregnant  and Sharon helps her tell the rest of the family: her father Joseph (Colman Domingo) and her sister Ernestine (Teyonah Parris). They are a little shocked but supportive  a tight-knit  loving group. After wondering when they should tell Fonny's family  Sharon decides to invite them over for drinks since it's a Saturday night and no time like the present.Throughout the film  we cut back to Tish and Fonny's life before he went to prison. We seem on an early date  walking through the city and getting to know one another. Back in the present  Fonny's parents  the jokester Frank (Michael Beach) and the cruel  religious Mrs. Hunt (Aunjanue Ellis) arrive with their two daughters. Mrs. Hunt and their daughters think they are too good for Tish and her family. When they tell Fonny's family  only Frank is positive. Mrs. Hunt curses Tish  and tells her the child is born from sin and is going to shrivel in her womb - and Frank punches her  hard. Everyone scrambles  Joseph takes Frank out  and Mrs. Hunt's daughters help her up. Sharon and Ernestine properly shame Mrs. Hunt  asking how she could be so cruel  and they kick the women out of their home.As the flashbacks continue  we see Tish and Fonny sleep together for the first time. In the present  Sharon and Tish go to see Hayward (Finn Wittrock)  a lawyer that is going to take Fonny's defense. Victoria Rogers (Emily Rios)  the victim  was a Puerto Rican woman living in New York when she was brutally assaulted. A white police officer  Officer Bell (Ed Skrein)  claims he saw Fonny running from the scene of the crime  even though Fonny was with his friend Daniel Carty (Brian Tyree Henry) at the time. He then showed Victoria the lineup  and she identified Fonny. Hayward explains there are two problems: one  Victoria is missing and can't be questioned. Two  the district attorney's office has arrested Carty and won't let Hayward see him. Hayward is going to fight but warns them it will be a tough battle to win.In flashbacks  Daniel gets out of prison after two years and comes to stay with Fonny and Tish. He is jovial  but his time in prison has shaken him. He clearly is drinking as a way to cope and confesses to Fonny that he pled guilty to stealing a car to get out of a marijuana charge after being pressured by police officers... even though he doesn't even know how to drive.Tish gets farther along in her pregnancy  working as a counter girl in a department store to make ends meet. Ernestine tells Tish that Victoria has been located... in Puerto Rico. Tish is devastated  knowing she can't get there to talk to her. Money is piling up for legal defenses  and Frank commiserates with Joseph  who assures him they'll get it done. They begin stealing from the docks and re-selling the goods.In flashbacks  we see when Tish and Fonny got their loft together. They had been turned away from many places simply for being black  but Levy (Dave Franco)  the young Jewish man showing them the space  tells them that love is love and he's his mother's son. Tish looks around a corner store while Fonny goes to get cigarettes  and while in the store  a young racist white man starts harassing her. Fonny arrives and throws the man out of the store  but Officer Bell (the man who will later say he saw Fonny running from the crime scene) arrives and threatens Fonny with assault charges. Tish and Fonny explain that he was defending Tish  but Bell refuses to listen and begins to arrest Fonny until the store manager  a white woman  comes forward and tells Bell that what they said was true and to leave them alone. Bell vows to see Fonny again.Sharon arrives in Puerto Rico  attempting to find Victoria. She first finds Pietro (Pedro Pascal)  Victoria's boyfriend. He at first refuses to help her find Victoria  but she passionately insists that Fonny didn't rape her and begs to speak with her. He helps her find Victoria  who is visibly traumatized from what happened to her. Sharon tries to speak with her  acknowledging what happened to her was horrible but trying to explain that she has the wrong man. Victoria explains that the police asked her to pick Fonny out and she did and that that's the end. Sharon explains that she only saw Fonny in the lineup Officer Bell showed her - she presses further  but Victoria begins screaming  hysterical  and is eventually taken away by other women  leaving Sharon alone  devastated.Tish goes to see Fonny in prison  who looks worse than ever. She has bad news: Victoria has disappeared again  and now the trial might be postponed. Fonny is distraught. Tish has the baby  and Fonny  faced with the prospect of losing the trial  takes a plea for a lesser sentence.Several years later  Tish brings their child  a young boy named after his father  to visiting hours at the prison. The three have a makeshift family dinner with food bought from the vending machines and enjoy having some moments actually together.  , 'Trust Love All the Way'

Grey leaves his wheelchair behind so that he can run to find Jamie.After Grey flees  Fisk shows up to the bar hours later and finds Tolan\'s body. He uses memory footage from a camera in Tolan\'s eye to see Grey repeating the address Stem gave him. Fisk then presses the bartender for letting Tolan die.

Grey attempts to shoot Eron  but Cortez appears and orders him to throw the gun away. Eron then reveals that he was not behind the murder plot  but it was always Stem who was controlling him. Stem grew to be too intelligent  and he wanted a body of his own  so he manipulated Eron into organizing everything to get Grey\'s body  even hacking Grey\'s car to cause the accident. Grey stabs his own hand to prevent himself from hurting anyone  but Stem takes full control of his body and mind to stab Eron in the head. He then takes a gun and aims it at Cortez while she is incapacitated. Grey then yells that he is in control and he shoots himself in the neck to destroy Stem.Grey wakes up in a hospital bed.

She is greeted at the home of Dovid Kuperman (Alessandro Nivola)  a\nson figure to the Rav  who is taken aback by the unexpected return of his childhood friend.\nHer welcome inside the home is hostile from those in the community gathering in the Rav's\nhonour. Her aunt Fruma Hartog (Bernice Stegers) greets her more openly  though the\nair is frosty between Ronit and her uncle Moshe Hartog (Allan Corduner). Ronit is both\nupset and angry that she was not informed of her father's illness and that her father's\nobituary claims he was childless.Despite tension surrounding Ronit's sudden departure in the past  Dovid invites her to stay\nwith him and his wife. Ronit is shocked to discover that he is married to their former best\nfriend Esti (Rachel McAdams)  now a teacher at an Orthodox girls' school. It is\nuncomfortable between the two women; a complicated past is clearly hanging over them.\nThe next day Ronit visits her father's grave. After further prayers at their home  Dovid  Esti\nand Ronit go to a dinner at the Hartog house with Rabbi Goldfarb (Nicholas Woodeson)\nand Rebbetzin Goldfarb (Liza Sadovy).

She leaves and soon runs into Esti outside a supermarket. They visit the\nRav's house together - a rundown mess full of medical equipment  it is not so much the\nhouse that Ronit wanted  but for her father to acknowledge her in his will. Esti admits that\nshe does not want Ronit to leave again; past feelings are reignited and they kiss  at first\ntimidly as Ronit pulls back  and then passionately. Ronit retreats once more  confused about\nher feelings.They leave the house and Esti confesses that she had called the Brooklyn Synagogue to let\nRonit know of her father's death. She tells Ronit that she married Dovid  a man she doesn't\nlove romantically but respects  as she was mentally unwell following Ronit's sudden\ndeparture and married their best friend upon the Rav's suggestion. As they relax into each\nother's company and kiss again  they are interrupted by Hinda (Clara Francis) and husband\nLev (Mark Stobbart) and are unsure how much they saw. Esti rushes home  tense; she\nalmost embraces Dovid but their marriage still lacks the passion she has with Ronit.\nAt school  Esti is summoned to see the headmistress Mrs. Shapiro (Caroline Gruber)\nwhere Hinda and Lev are waiting to confront her.

-1.525779,2018,Thoroughbreds,5,92,6.6,549,20180309,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,  The movie opens with a young woman  Amanda (Olivia Cooke)  in a stable with her horse  Honeymooner. She gently pets him and then reaches into her bag and pulls out a knife.Amanda is brought to the home of her childhood friend Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) so that she can tutor Amanda. Amanda tells Lily she can't seem to feel genuine emotions  and her behavior is frequently off-putting to Lily  which is why they haven't been friends in so long. Amanda also finds out that her mom paid Lily to hang out with her instead of just tutoring her  although Lily tries to deny it.Amanda meets Lily's stepfather Mark (Paul Sparks)  who is rude to Lily and annoys her by constantly using a rowing machine. Noticing that Lily hates Mark  Amanda prods her with questions until she eventually suggests that she should kill him. Lily thinks it's a dumb plan.Some time later  Lily attends a party where her peers are talking about how Amanda mutilated her horse and that there are pictures of the crime scene floating around the internet. Outside  an argument is taking place between the party's host and an older guy named Tim (Anton Yelchin)  who is trying to hit on the guy's sister. Another guy notes that Tim did jail time for statutory rape. The first guy hits Tim in the face and makes him leave. As Lily is leaving the party  she runs into Tim  who tries to engage her in conversation  but she is not interested.Lily finds out from her mom (Francie Smith) that she got expelled from her private school for plagiarizing a paper  and now she is being sent to a different school  which Mark has already paid for. Lily responds by going to sabotage Mark's rowing machine  which later results in him having a broken nose and wrist. When Lily's mom tries to help him  Mark acts like a dick to her. This brings Lily to meet with Amanda again to decide that she definitely does want to kill Mark. However  Amanda notes that it wouldn't be easy since she is already awaiting trial for animal cruelty  so if she were anywhere near the crime scene  she would be screwed. Amanda reveals that she killed Honeymooner because he was in pain and couldn't walk anymore. She tells Lily they need to establish alibis and be away from the area.The girls find Tim working at a retirement home and they hire him to carry out the hit on Mark. He goes with them to Lily's house where they plan to set things up for the murder  and that it needs to be the upcoming Saturday since Lily is going to a spa with her mom and Amanda takes psychotherapy sessions. When Tim sounds hesitant  Amanda plays an audio recording of Tim selling hard drugs to a minor. Tim pulls out a gun and taunts the girls by pointing it at them until Amanda knocks him over the head with a lamp  resulting in a head injury. The girls blackmail Tim into going through with the plan or they will send the audio to the police.Come Saturday  Mark is home alone. He notices the light from outside go on as Tim is creeping through the back  but he only goes to get his gun that the girls hid in a grill  and he leaves Mark alone.The girls realize Tim failed to carry out the hit  but they know he can't report them due to his own criminal record. Lily and Mark later argue over him sending her to a boarding school while Amanda hides while holding a knife. Mark chastises Lily for smoking in the house  to which Lily responds that he should leave her mother if he really cares about her. Mark tells her he is going to cut off her funding after the school year is up.At night  the girls are watching a movie when Lily admits to Amanda that she spiked her screwdriver with Rohypnol so that she can kill Mark herself and frame Amanda for it. Lily tries to back out  but Amanda chugs the drink and tells her to go through with the plan because she feels her own life is going nowhere. After Amanda passes out  Lily goes upstairs. We hear thumping sounds  and Lily runs back downstairs covered in Mark's blood. She rubs some of it on Amanda and lays next to her.A while later  Lily arrives at a restaurant for a college interview. She finds Tim working there as a valet. He heard about Mark's murder  but Lily is clearly doing fine. Tim asks about Amanda  who was sent to a mental institution after being framed. Lily tells Tim that Amanda sent her a letter. We hear Amanda's voice as we see her in the institution  with her describing a dream to Lily about Amanda being a horse  and another where she is Honeymooner and her spirit rises to see time speed up where new people are moving into the neighborhood and making things better. When Tim asks Lily what the letter said  she says she just threw it out.'Dedicated to Anton Yelchin.'  , 'Good Breeding Gone Bad'

He has to use the bathroom and he freaks out after flushing the toilet because of how loud it is. Marlo tries to calm him down when a teacher walks by and manages to calm Jonah down by pretending they are trees.When Marlo sees Tully again  she mentions going through Drew\'s browser history and seeing that he has some kind of fetish for waitresses wearing a specific uniform from something out of a diner from the 50\'s.

The boy now grown  Jared  is a teenager sitting in church while his dad  Marshall Eamons (Russell Crowe)  gives a sermon about how nobody\'s perfect. Jared\'s mom  Nancy (Nicole Kidman)  is cheerful as she listens to the sermon while Jared gets the attention of a young lady nearby. We flash forward to shortly after when Jared  now 18  is being driven by his mom to some location. He puts his arm out the window to simulate surfing the air and his mom tells him not to do that. When he asks why  she says that a kid\'s arm was once taken off by a truck driver that way. He relents and rolls up the window.Jared gets to a facility where he has to sign in and also give up all his belongings until his mom returns to get him at 5 PM. Michael  an effeminate employee of the clinic  is rather sharp with him regarding him having to give up his belongings (including cell phones which were becoming common in 2004  when the story is set) and tells him that he has to delete anyone from his phone that will be a problem. They will dial numbers at random to verify that he has  so he\'d better be honest about it. He takes Jared\'s journal and says it will have to be reviewed by Victor Sykes  who is in charge. Jared is given a tour of the facility and sees many young people in different rooms  all in various forms of therapy. At orientation  all the incoming teenagers and young adults read the rules out loud  one at a time - females are told they have to wear bras at all times; men are told can\'t make physical contact with each other except for the briefest of handshakes. Nobody can go into a bathroom without any staff member supervising them. It becomes clear the clinic  called Love in Action  is a gay conversion program.Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton  also writer/director) gives a sermon to the group. He holds up a dollar bill and tells them that even if he crumples it  it still has its value. Even if he rips it  you can tape it together - it will have a scar but still have value. He considers their homosexual feelings to be sins and a choice they made. He gestures towards a robust teen  Cameron  and points out he plays football though he wasn\'t born a football player - he chose to play football - and likewise he chose to have homosexual thoughts. Among the other students are Gary (played by musician Troye Sivan) and Jon (played by Xavier Dolan). Jon enters late and we learn he has done the program before and has been forced back - when we first meet him  he has a scratch on his nose and later he has a black eye  alluding to an abusive father. There is also a young woman named Sarah who seems very shy and nervous about being in attendance.The group is told that they have to make a sort of family tree and list all the hardships people in their family have faced. which is a direct line to why they are having homosexual thoughts. Among the list is homosexual/same sex attraction  drugs  alcoholism  gang affiliation  criminal behavior  and use of pornography. Jared makes his tree but can\'t think of a single thing to attribute to any of his relatives except suggesting that maybe his Uncle Chris is an alcoholic. Victor stops by and notes that his family\'s lack of toxic behavior is the sign that Jared is truly the son of a preacher. He encourages him to consider his Uncle Chris as an alcoholic since Jared has put a question mark next to the one and only affliction he felt was applicable.We flashback to Jared in high school. He is living a normal life in his Texas high school. He is on the basketball team (but only plays for five minutes) and dates a cheerleader. His dad  revealed to own a Ford dealership in town  grants him a new Ford vehicle for his upcoming birthday. Jared takes his girlfriend to the lake with friends and they have a fun night out. When he drops her off at home  they kiss in the car. She pressures him to do more  but he suggests maybe they should wait. She points out that they\'re going to college soon.In present day  Jared goes to collect his belongings and returns back to the hotel with his mom. He realizes that pages of his journal have been ripped out. Michael  the bitchy  ex-gay  employee  tells him journaling isn\'t allowed and Victor will have to evaluate the material to see if it\'s suitable to have written.Outside  Jared meets Jon  who says he had done the therapy before and is being forced to participate again. Jon has a scratch on his nose and explains his saluting people as a purposeful way to avoid male contact.That night  Jared and Nancy go out to dinner and he passes Sarah in the hall  staying at the same hotel with her parent. At the restaurant  Jared asks her if any of their relatives had any problems on the list; she tells him their family has always been  normal  and after reading the list  laughs about the idea that they could be related to someone with the kinds of problems listed. At night  she jokes that she was once in prison because of her gang affiliation and drug problems  showing her sense of humor and relationship with her son.The next day at Love in Action  Victor mocks the term LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) and the idea of inclusion for people with various sexual orientations. The group is introduced to an older man with a lot of tattoos named Brandon (played by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) who tells the group that he doesn\'t relate to their afflictions (same sex attraction) but he\'s guilty of a lot of others - implying he was a drug addict and alcoholic - and that his commitment to God had turned his life around. He says that all the counselors there were once like them  and that\'s when Jared learns that Victor is actually an  ex-gay  (shocking because he comes off so homophobic). Brandon evaluates the men on their masculinity and points out that some are sitting with crossed legs  which is not manly. The young men are next lined up outside and evaluated on the way they stand - telling them they have to put their hands on their hips so it forms the strong shape of a triangle. He berates one boy for having his hands turned inward on his hips. He then has female student Sarah line the boys up in terms of masculinity based on how they come off  using her instincts as to who is the least masculine. Cameron  the boy who was applauded earlier for being a football player  is placed at the very end of the line. Brandon berates him nonetheless and makes him feel like he is not masculine enough.The boys are then forced into a batting cage to try to make them more manly. One very small and fey boy is afraid of the ball  yet Victor demands he get close to where the balls are being loaded - one hits the boy in the helmet and he is knocked down. When Jared goes up to bat  he\'s the only one who is able to hit the ball with ease  which impresses Victor. Each group member has to make a Moral Inventory list of impurities they\'ve suffered. Jared ponders what to write down.At Love in Action therapy  each student/client is required to get up in front of class and give a speech about all their impurities. Called up  Sarah nervously tells people that she ran away from home and stayed with a girl who  put her mouth on  touched  and can barely explain that she is referring to intercourse by adding  my vagina.  It\'s obviously very painful for her to talk about this in a way where she has to be apologetic and ashamed  but Victor blows off her struggle with a congratulatory response.Afterward  seeing how wounded this public disclosure has left her  Jared tries to console Sarah but  left raw  she absolutely wants to be left alone. An outside ruckus draws everyone\'s attention. The boy who was beaned by a ball in the batting cage is being removed from the facility by his angry parents  who\'ve paid $3 000 for the course where his son was put in danger and could have had a concussion. Afterward  Victor Sykes hotly admonishes everyone against talking about therapy outside of therapy.Back at the hotel with nothing to say to his mom  Jared writes down Henry\'s name in his Moral Inventory page.We flash back to Jared starting college. As he struggles to move a lot of heavy boxes  a young man  Henry (Joe Alwyn)  assists him and helps him to his room. Henry takes an intense liking to Jared and the two go jogging together  the loser to attend the other\'s church. One night  Jared and Henry are in Jared\'s dorm while Jared\'s roommate is out of town. At Jared\'s invite  Henry decides to stay the night and goes to sleep on the top bunk. Later  Jared hears Henry tossing and turning and asks if he\'s having trouble sleeping. Henry climbs down and gets into bed with Jared. There\'s mutual but cautious attraction at first  but Henry soon climbs unexpectedly atop Jared and begins to rape him  covering Jared\'s mouth to muffle his screams. This goes on for a while until neighbors  beating on the wall  tell them to be quiet. Henry gets off of Jared  breaks down  admits he has a problem  and confesses that there was a guy at his church (whom Jared met earlier) that Henry\'d done  bad things  with. (It is later implied he had sodomized that guy  too - not that they were in a consensual relationship).Now a victim of rape and crying in shame  Jared sits distracted in his classrooms and begins blowing off Henry. Henry  infuriated and nervous that Jared will tell authorities what he\'s done  calls Nancy  pretending to be a counselor at the school  and tells her that her son seems to be a homosexual and she should have cause for concern.Jared is forced to come home where Marshall confronts him about this and Nancy stands by. Jared explains it wasn\'t a counselor but another student who had admitted to raping someone at his church and made the call because he was afraid Jared would report it. There is still the lingering question of whether or not Jared has had homosexual feelings. After he takes some time  he finally decides to be forthright to his parents and admits that he has had thoughts of men. Both parents seem very distraught by this information.That night  two men come over and have a chat with Marshall. When Jared inquires about this  Nancy tells him that they are people from the church who were asked for advice on the situation. One of them  a pastor  has had a son in the same exact situation over ten years earlier  and they suggest Marshall respond in the same fashion -- to put Jared into gay conversion program. When Jared is asked if he wants to change (his homosexuality)  he sees his mom\'s desperation and replies   Yes.  They all pray together.Jared is sent to a doctor (Cherry Jones) to give blood because his dad wants to check his testosterone levels. The doctor says she is a lover of God but also went to medical school and knows that they\'re not going to find anything except that Jared\'s a healthy teenage boy. She asks about his sexuality but he skirts the issue  now determined to not disappoint his mother and father.Victor discusses a story by Jared he read and ripped from his journal  a fictional love story about a boy and a girl. Victor asks if Jared secretly meant the two characters to be both boys. Jared says it\'s just a story for college. Victor tells him that colleges assign books like Dorian Gray and Lolita to students and he thinks it\'s not the right place for Jared to be right now. Jared always expected the gay conversion therapy to be a very short term thing but he starts to realize he might be forced to stay at the housing instead of returning to school.In therapy  client Gary gives a speech about how he had been living in sin by committing sodomy over am entire year  but now he\'s  awakened  to his sins and thanks everyone  especially Victor  for helping him get back on the path to righteousness.While riding again with his mom  Jared puts his hand out the window to surf the rush of air. She tells him again how she\'s nervous (that a truck will come by and take off his arm) and he tells her he knows that\'s never happened. Nancy admits that moms just worry about their kids and want them to be safe. Lying for that reason is a good thing.Growing distant from her at dinner  Jared decides to go on a late night run. While on the street  he passes an advertisement with a sexy male model. He touches the image then throws something at it  breaking it and shouting  FUCK YOU   angry at having feelings for men.Back at the hotel  Jared finds Nancy reading his program book to understand more about what he\'s going through. In his Moral Inventiory list  he scratches out Henry and writes  Zavier. In flashback back to college  Jared meets Xavier at an art school  God Vs. Science  exhibit. Xavier is a handsome young Viennese man and the two go back to Xavier\'s place after the show and discuss the belief of God. Xavier asks Jared if he believes in the devil and then wonders if he considers Xavier the devil (because he senses that Jared is attracted to him). Xavier promises to prove that God will not smite him. He crosses to his bedroom. stays clothed  and sits on the bed. (The scene ends here.)In therapy  Cameron  the boy praised for being a football player  is chosen to do an exercise where he has to talk to an invisible chair as if it was his father and tell him why he hates him - the implication being that hatred of a father is why a man has sexual feelings for other men. Cameron struggles with this  reluctant to call his homosexual yearnings  my sins  rather than  my problem. Coming to his defense  Jared volunteers to do the exercise in his place  but Victor shoots this down and says it\'s Cameron\'s task. He then embarrasses Cameron for struggling. Victor releases the class for a break  all but Cameron  who has to stay seated in the chair until he\'s ready to tap into his anger and show it convincingly to everyone. Sympathetically  Jared squeezes Cameron\'s shoulder as he passes.On the break  Gary (sporting a black eye) tells Jared that everyone saw his shoulder squeeze and that it violates the rule against touching other men. It\'s best if Jared abides by the rules and for all to succumb to what is being demanded of them. Jared says they\'re all struggling to make this work and that he\'s having a tough time  just like Gary. Gary claims he\'s fine  but Jared says it doesn\'t seem that way.Jared  winding up in am institute bathroom by himself  sees Victor outside the window  sneaking a cigarette while nervously looking around  apparently afraid he\'ll be caught. Brandon finds Jared and scolds him for being in a bathroom unattended. Jared tries to leave but Brandon encourages him to pee as planned. Pee shy  the stream comes off intermittently and Brandon says it sounds like he\'s using Morse code  asking  Are you sending me a message  faggot?  Jared says nothing in response  too afraid to say anything.Outside  Jon tells Jared that he has to  lean into  what is being requested of him by the staff or else they will decide that he  like Sarah  has to be housed (in an adjacent building) where he\'ll have to stay for a year instead of leaving daily like everyone else at 5:00 PM. He should get back home and then figure out what to do next  which could mean walking away from everything and everyone he knows.On the phone  Jared tells his dad he wants to leave  but Marshall tells him to find the strength and commitment inside himself to stick it out. Jared complies. The next morning  Nancy finds a note from Jared saying he\'s walking to the center and will meet her at 5:00.At Love in Action  the counselors stage a funeral for Cameron. Cameron\'s family attends  crying over a coffin and pretending that Cameron has died by  Satan\'s wishes.  Victor asks Cameron if that\'s what he wants then invites others to come and  strike this demon down.  Cameron\'s dad steps forth  takes a Bible  and beats Cameron with it to exorcise his demons  being very aggressive with how hard he hits Cameron. Cameron\'s sister is next invited to step forth and have a whack. Jared steps outside to avoid seeing more and to think about this. Jon grabs his arm to compel him to stay; Jared looks at this and both realize that Jon has broken his long-standing practice of not touching another male. While outside  Jared spots Sarah (as she does him). She looks isolated  friendless and trapped. It seems evident that Jared must fall into the program in order to make it through and out.At the next therapy session  Victor says he feels invigorated and asks Cameron how he feels. Cameron says he feels great with the true presence of God in his heart.Flashback: Jared and Zavier lie in bed together  fully dressed but looking at each other  lightly caressing each other\'s face.It\'s Jared\'s turn to give the inventory of his past sins  so he talks about being with Xavier. As he relays this to the class  Victor tells him he is leaving something out. Jared denies he had any other  gay  experiences  but Victor tells him his father told him about Henry. Jared says that\'s not applicable (since it was actually rape)  but Victor insists he had slanted the truth to protect himself (upon explaining the situation to his father) and that he needs to stop lying. Jared tells him he isn\'t lying. He could make something up and say what Victor wants to hear  but then he WOULD be lying  and the whole purpose is to denounce sins. Noting his anger  Victor forces him to parlay that into the exercise where he yells at his invisible dad in the empty chair. Victor encourages him to tell his dad why he hates him and Jared says he doesn\'t hate his dad. This doesn\'t assuage Victor  who points out Jared is angry. Yes  Jared is angry  but at Victor  not his dad. As Victor refuses to believe this and keeps insisting Jared is lying to himself  Jared gets fed up and storms out of the room  saying that everyone there is crazy.Jared  chased by Victor and followed by the rest of the class  bursts into the administration area to retrieve his things from the storage unit where they keep the bins with everyone\'s belongings. Michael  the flamboyant staff member  chases after Jared but Victor tells Michael to let the counselors handle it. Jared runs to the bathroom  with Victor in pursuit  and asks Victor to give him a minute. From a stall  Jared then calls his mom with his retrieved cell phone; fortunately she picks up right away and he tells her  sobbing  that she needs to come get him. Jared then goes out in the hall and says his mom coming to pick him up and they can\'t keep him anymore. He is pursued and Jared says that if Victor puts his hands on him  the entire class is there and they will be witnesses. When Nancy arrives  Victor and other counselors are holding Jared down while they recite prayers. Nancy is locked out but can see her son through the window in the door. Victor tries to get her to come back later but she refuses and demands they open the door. Compelled  Cameron steps forward  shoves Victor aside  tells them to let Jared go  then guides Jared to the door. They finally unlock the doors and Nancy takes Jared out into the parking lot  pursued by Victor. As Victor tells her she\'s ruining the boy  she fires back and points out that he\'s not a legitimate counselor nor qualified to educate or psychologically evaluate  and she should have known better than to give him authority over her son. As she drives away  she shouts   Shame on them  then says   and shame on me  too. Jared waits for his mom at an empty restaurant while she has a phone conversation with his father. She returns and tells him his father wants him to go back to the center. While this sinks in  she explains that she had sat idly by while the men decided what would happen to Jared. She now needs her husband to sit by while she makes a decision. Jared returns home but his father has resentment towards him. At church  his dad gives a strong sermon about how you can show up at church but it doesn\'t make you a Christian  focusing his gaze at Jared. The rest of the congregations shouts  amen  to this but Nancy shoots a look of disgust at her husband and clutches Jared tightly.Sometime Jater as Jared packs  the doorbell rings and Nancy asks Jared if he knows Cameron (the football player given a fake funeral who ushered Jared to freedom). Jared wonder in surprise if Cameron\'s at the door  but Nancy tells him she just learned from police that he had killed himself and the officers have come by to ask questions of him about Love in Action. He answers there questions but has no interest in talking with his dad.Four years later.Jared is now living in New York and has a lot of friends. He is a writer and working on an article. His mom emails him that she was right - he clicks on a link and it\'s an article about a kid who had his arm ripped off while sticking it out a car window. He Instant Messages her  asking if she\'s read the article. She has and is proud of him. He then asks if his dad has read it but she changes the subject  asking if he\'s coming for Thanksgiving. He doesn\'t drop the subject and says it\'s important for his father to read about his experience with the gay conversion therapy. She says he\'ll read it on his own time. When he learns that she\'s staying with his aunt  he wonders what is happening with their relationship. Nancy says it\'s only temporary  but it\'s obvious her relationship with Marshall is strained because she remains supportive of their son and he has not.When Jared next returns home  his dad is out and he asks his mom about their marriage. She says she knows that she has love for God and love for her son and the two don\'t conflict - for her father it\'s not that simple. That night  Jared waits on the patio for his dad and then asks him to read his article from the New York Times and tells him there are talks of him turning it into a book. Marshall is cordial but definitely doesn\'t exhibit any signs of unconditional love - it\'s clear he still wants his son to  choose  not to be gay anymore.One night  Nancy comes into the room with Marshall and gives him a folder - he opens it up and finds the article. He begins to read. When Jared and Marshall are next seen  it is at the Ford dealership Marshall owns. Marshall says he has a present for Jared. He suspects it will be a Ford vehicle  like when he was in high school  but it\'s actually an expensive pen that Marshall uses for sermons and says he wants to give it to him   from one writer to another.  Jared tells him he\'s gay and that will never change and he thinks they should stop forcing a relationship if it results only in small talk and no connection. Marshall admits he is disappointed he won\'t have grandkids and also that the dealership won\'t be Jared\'s - explaining he always pictured him taking over the family business. Even though Marshall still has issues with him  they seem to find a peace between the two of them.In the end  title cards reveal that the inspiration for Jared  Garrard Conley  now lives with his husband in NYC.

18.883444,2018,On the Basis of Sex,20,120,7.1,33,20190111,0,1,0,0,0,0,0, 'In 1956 Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Felicity Jones) is a first-year student at Harvard Law School. When her husband Martin (Armie Hammer)  a second-year student  falls ill with cancer  she attends both her classes and his  taking notes and transcribing lectures while caring for Martin and their infant daughter Jane (Cailee Spaeny). Two years later Martin  his cancer in remission  is hired by a firm in New York. Ruth petitions Harvard Law School Dean Griswold (Sam Waterston) to allow her to finish her Harvard law degree with classes at Columbia Law School in New York  but he insists on following Harvard University policies at the time and denies her request  so she transfers to Columbia. In spite of graduating at the top of her class  she is unable to find a position with a law firm because none of the firms she applies to want to hire a woman. She takes a job as a professor at Rutgers Law School  teaching  Sex Discrimination and the Law .In 1970  Martin brings Moritz v. Commissioner  a tax law case to Ruth\'s attention. Charles Moritz (Chris Mulkey) is a man from Denver who had to hire a nurse to help him care for his aging mother so he could continue to work. Moritz was denied a tax deduction for the nursing care because at the time Section 214 of the Internal Revenue Code specifically limited the deduction to  a woman  a widower or divorcee  or a husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized .The court ruled that Moritz  a man who had never married  did not qualify for the deduction. Ruth sees in this case an opportunity to begin to challenge the many laws enacted over the years that assume that men will work to provide for the family  and women will stay home and take care of the husband and children. She believes that if she could set a precedent ruling that a man was unfairly discriminated against on the basis of sex  that precedent could be cited in cases challenging laws that discriminate against women-and she believes that an appellate court composed entirely of male judges would find it easier to identify with a male appellant.Ruth meets with Mel Wulf (Justin Theroux) of the ACLU to try to enlist their help  but he turns her down. She also meets with activist and civil rights advocate Dorothy Kenyon (Kathy Bates)  who is cold to the idea at first but later meets with Wulf in his office and convinces him to sign on. Ruth then flies to Denver to meet with Moritz  who agrees to let the Ginsburgs and ACLU represent him pro Bono after Ruth convinces him that millions of people could potentially benefit. The Ginsburgs and Wulf file an appeal of Moritz\'s denial with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.Department of Justice Attorney James H. Bozarth (Jack Reynor) asks to be the lead counsel for the defense. He does a computer search to find all of the sections of the US Code that deal with gender. His defense will contend that  if section 214 is ruled unconstitutional  that will open the door to challenge all of America\'s gender-based laws. Ruth  having no courtroom experience  does poorly in a moot court (organized at her house to help her practice)  and Wulf convinces her to let Martin lead off arguing the tax law  with Ruth following up with equal protection arguments.The government offers Moritz a settlement of one dollar. Ruth makes a counter-proposal: the government will pay Moritz the sum he claimed as a deduction and make a declaration that he did nothing wrong  and also enter into the record that the gender-based portion of section 214 is unconstitutional. The government declines this proposal because of the constitutionality element. At the oral argument in the Court of Appeals  Martin takes more of their side\'s allotted time than he had intended. Ruth is nervous but makes several key points and reserves four minutes of her time for rebuttal.Bozarth frames his side\'s argument as defending the American way of life  implying that the Ginsburgs and ACLU want  radical social change  and maybe Moritz  just doesn\'t want to pay his taxes . In her rebuttal  Ruth is much more confident. She states that societal roles that existed one hundred years ago  or even twenty years ago  no longer apply. She does not ask the court to change society  but to keep the law up with social change that has already taken place. To a judge\'s objection that the Constitution does not contain the word  woman   she responds vigorously that neither does it contain the word  freedom .Outside the courthouse  judgment being reserved  Wulf  Moritz and the Ginsburgs celebrate that  win or lose  Ruth has finally found her voice as a lawyer. Titles over the closing scene indicate that the Court of Appeals found unanimously in Moritz\'s favor. Ruth went on to co-found the Women\'s Rights Project at the ACLU  which struck down many of the gender-based laws Bozarth identified  and in 1993 the Senate voted 96 to 3 for her to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

22.020146,2018,Mary Queen of Scots,25,125,6.3,4,20181221,0,1,0,0,0,0,0, 'In 1561  Mary (Saoirse Ronan)  Queen of Scotland and former Queen Consort of France  returns from France to her half-brother the Earl of Moray\'s (James McArdle) home in Scotland after her husband\'s death. In England  her cousin  Elizabeth (Margot Robbie) is the Queen of England - she is unmarried and has no child  and is threatened by Mary\'s claim to the English throne. John Knox (David Tennant)  a Protestant cleric on Mary\'s council  is incensed about a Catholic being in charge of the country and is abusive to Mary.Elizabeth wants to control Mary and weaken her claim to the throne and thinks the best way to do this would be to marry her to an English subject. She is herself in love with Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn) but decides to offer him to Mary. He protests  only wanting to be with her  but Elizabeth sends him anyway. However  once she meets with Dudley  Mary refuses to marry him  since he is a commoner and not royal - unless she is named as the next in line to the English throne. Elizabeth balks but is stricken with smallpox. Hearing of her impending death  Mary agrees to marry Dudley - once she is named the successor. Elizabeth  not genuinely wanting to let Dudley go  sends Lord Darnley (Jack Lowden) to Scotland. He claims to only be there for religious freedom  but Mary knows this is not true. He is charming  however  and their bond grows until eventually  he proposes.Because Darnley has royal blood  he actually strengthens Mary\'s claim to the throne  and Elizabeth\'s advisers tell her to put a stop to the marriage and press the marriage of Dudley to Mary. Mary\'s council itself is also suspicious of Darnley\'s motives  assuming that he wants to take over their country on behalf of England. The English ambassador comes to Scotland and demands that Darnley return to England  but Mary refuses  since she\'s doing as asked and marrying an Englishman. This enrages Moray  who doesn\'t want to go to war over his sister\'s passion. He leaves the Queen\'s council.England supports Moray in a rebellion against Mary. Mary and Darnley marry  but the next morning Mary finds him in bed with her male friend David Rizzio (Ismael Cruz Cordova). She is upset but has a rebellion by some Scottish nobles to deal with. Rizzio goes to Mary  sorry and begging for forgiveness - Mary does indeed forgive him  saying they both fell for Darnley\'s charms and that they must be careful. Mary\'s forces are able to quash the rebellion  and she spares Moray\'s life. She then forces Darnley to have sex with her so that she can conceive an heir. When she announces her pregnancy  she declares the child the  heir to Scotland and England   which naturally greatly offends the English.Moray meets with Darnley\'s father Matthew (Brendan Coyle) to hatch a plan to undermine Mary. A rumor starts that Rizzio is actually the father of Mary\'s child and that she is an adulterer  which gives Knox fuel to preach to the Scottish that Mary is an evil woman. The under-miners meet with Darnley  telling him he needs to sign the bond for their plan to remove Rizzio. He refuses  but his father warns him that in the public perception either he is the adulterer or Mary is  and this way no one needs to know of his homosexuality. He reluctantly signs. Mary  her handmaids  and Rizzio are playing games upstairs when the plotters burst in to execute Rizzio. Mary physically stands in the way but is unable to stop them as they stab Rizzio over and over  to her horror. The nobles insist that Darnley deliver the killer blow.The nobles bring Moray back into the fold  and they demand pardons for all the rebels. Mary wants to know if Darnley knew of the plot and they tell her he signed a bond. She agrees to the pardon if they can prove Darnley knew  and they agree. She makes peace with Moray. She writes to Elizabeth  asking her to be the godmother. They strike a deal: if Elizabeth has children  they will be heirs to the throne  but if not  it will be Mary\'s child - much to the chagrin of Elizabeth\'s council. Mary confronts Darnley with his signature on the bond and banishes him from her sight. He is angry  wanting to be with his child  but she tells him he is lucky to keep his life. Mary\'s council begs her to divorce him  claiming that he still plots to take the throne  but she refuses to be a queen who keeps getting married over and over. The council approaches Bothwell (Martin Compston) an advisor and protector of Mary\'s  and they all arrange to have Darnley killed.In the ensuing melee after Darnley\'s death  Mary is forced to leave her child with her maids and flee. The very next day  Bothwell tells her that the council says she needs to marry a Scotsman as soon as possible and they have decided on him. Mary doesn\'t want to  but faced with seemingly no choice  she goes through with it. This gives Knox more fuel to preach that Mary is a harlot and that she had Darnley killed herself. Moray and other advisers tell Mary she must abdicate and that the country does not trust her. Bothwell is furious  but Mary tells him he\'s a fool - this was their plan all along to remove her. Moray begs her to abdicate so they can be a family. Mary says he\'s holding her son hostage  and that they are no longer family. She refuses to abdicate.Elizabeth is sad to hear of what has been happening  and the two cousins arrange a clandestine meeting. Elizabeth tells Mary no one can know of the meeting. Mary asks for help getting her throne back  but Elizabeth tells her she cannot go to war on a Catholic\'s behalf. Mary offers to make obeisance to Elizabeth but Elizabeth sadly still refuses  but says that she is safe in England. Elizabeth tells Mary as long as she does not aid England\'s enemies  she will be unharmed. Mary says if she does so  it will only be because Elizabeth pushed her there  and if she murders Mary  she murders her own sister queen. Elizabeth orders Mary to be imprisoned in England.Some years later  Elizabeth receives evidence that indicates Mary conspired with her enemies to kill her. She doesn\'t know if it is true but has no choice but to act  and orders Mary\'s execution. Elizabeth cries for Mary. Mary is taken to her execution and reveals a scarlet dress  the colour of martyrdom. In her last thoughts  she wishes her son James well and hopes for peace upon his reign.The postscript tells us that upon Elizabeth\'s death in 1603  James became the first monarch to rule both England and Scotland.' , 'Born to Fight'  'Born to Power'  'Bow to No One'  'Two Queens.

It then cuts to another video from Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard (Alec Baldwin)  who launches into a racist tirade of how African Americans are taking over the country and causing trouble for white Protestant Americans.Colorado Springs  CO. 1979Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) arrives at the local police station. He is interviewed by Chief Bridges (Robert John Burke) and Mr. Turrerntine (Isiah Whitlock  Jr.) over whether or not he would be qualified on the force. Given the current social and political climate regarding African Americans  they want to know how Ron would react if a white officer were to harass him  and Ron says he would turn the other cheek if he needs to. Ron is then made the first black officer on the force.Ron\'s first job is to work in the filing department. He is antagonized by a Patrolman named Andy Landers (Frederick Weller). Ron then goes to Bridges and requests that he be put on an assignment to get out in the field  but Bridges declines his request. However  Bridges later changes his mind and decides to send Ron to a Black Panther meeting to see if they are planning to radicalize themselves. A known activist  Stokely Carmichael (Corey Hawkins)  is said to be speaking there. Bridges has Detectives Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) and Jimmy Creek (Michael Buscemi) sit in as Ron goes in with a wire.Ron attends the meeting and meets Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrier)  head of the Black Student Union. He tries to convince her that he is down with their cause. They enter for the meeting  where Carmichael  now going as Kwame Ture  starts to speak. He gives an impassioned speech of how everyone there must learn to love their black culture and to not be ashamed or try to conform for white folks. Kwame then starts to speak about an impending race war between black people and white officers who are constantly killing them in the streets  and that the black community must arm themselves in the face of a threat. Ron becomes invested in Kwame\'s words  but also weary about his beliefs in a race war.Later  Ron meets Patrice at a club. She tells him that they were pulled over by racist white police officers while taking Kwame back to the airport. We see the incident  and Landers was the one who pulled them over and started harassing Patrice while two other officers were holding them at gunpoint. They discuss their feelings on the matter  and how the relationship between black folks and the police are  before they head out on the dance floor.After bringing his information back to Bridges  Ron feels that they need not look further into the Black Panthers despite Bridges hearing about Kwame talking about the race war. Ron goes to the intelligence office to answer phones and sits to read a paper. He finds an ad for the Ku Klux Klan  and he becomes compelled to call. Ron poses as a white man as he speaks to a Klan chapter president named Walter Breachway (Ryan Eggold) over the phone  and Ron manages to convince Walter that is is  in fact  a racist white Aryan man. They arrange for a meeting to be set up  although Ron realizes he screwed up by using his real name. Ron brings this to Bridges and requests to use one of the white officers to play the Ron Stallworth that Walter thinks he spoke to. They decide to use Flip  and they use a script to differentiate between speaking  white English  and  jive . Flip is also given a wire to use for his face-to-face meetings with the Klan.Flip meets another Klan member named Felix Kendrickson (Jasper Paakonen) while Ron and Jimmy are attempting to keep a close watch on them. Felix drives Flip to one of the Klan\'s meeting spots  but he reminds Flip to refer to them as  The Organization . Felix spots Ron driving close behind him  and he has Flip load a gun just in case. They drive off and Ron gets off his tail when he realizes he was noticed. Felix then brings Flip to a pool hall where he meets Walter and a constantly drunk Klansman named Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser). Felix keeps suspecting that Flip might be Jewish (he is)  but Flips convinces Walter that he is just as racist as the rest of them.In between the investigation  Ron continues to see Patrice  having to hide the fact that he is a cop since she hates them and always refers to them as  pigs . She and her fellow BSU members are also disturbed by the appearance of Klan fliers all around the neighborhood. Ron has the police intervene on Klan activity  like cross-burnings.Ron speaks to Sergeant Trapp (Ken Garito)  as they are trying to gather information on the Grand Wizard of the Klan  David Duke (Topher Grace)  who is running for office  and they want to prevent him from going any higher since they don\'t want someone like Duke in office. Ron believes that people would never vote for someone like him  but Trapp tells him to wake up.Ron listens in on another meeting as Flip goes to Felix\'s house to meet other Klansmen and Felix\'s wife Connie (Ashlie Atkinson). They are planning something against Patrice and her group  since they know she has been so vocal about her stance on racism and police brutality. Felix  still not trusting Flip  brings him into his basement for a  Jew lie detector test . Sensing trouble  Ron runs up to the house and throws a rock through a window to scare Connie  and then run like hell before the men run out with guns. Flip shoots at the car but intentionally misses to prove to the others he\'s on their side.Felix looks up Ron Stallworth in the phone book and goes to Ron\'s apartment to find him there with Patrice. Felix later asks Flip about this during another meeting  but Flip says his number is unlisted and that he lives on a different street.Ron then manages to get in touch with Duke himself. Like the others that spoke to Ron on the phone  he is also convinced that Ron is a  true white American . Ron  however  has to hide his disgust with Duke\'s rhetoric and racist talk against black folks. At the same time  Flip is made the head of the Klan\'s chapter since he\'s gained trust among the others  but he tries to tell them that he can\'t perform his duties with them consistently because of his ill father. He slips up when mentioning this because Ron had said his sick dad was in El Paso  and Flip said Dallas  which the others catch onto until Flip corrects himself.Felix  Connie  and Ivanhoe meet with another Klansman named Walker (Nicholas Turturro) who brings them C4 that they plan to use against the BSU  although Patrice is their main target.Bridges assigns Ron to protect Duke as he is arriving in town. Landers makes more snide remarks toward Ron  leading him to snap and almost attack him. Bridges tells him that if he let Landers get to him so easily  he won\'t stand a chance with Duke.Ron goes to find Patrice to warn her not to go to a planned march with the BSU  because that\'s where the Klan is planning to attack them. He has to reveal to Patrice that he is a cop  and she becomes so upset that she refuses to see him  even as he tries to tell her that while he is down for the liberation of their people  he is loyal to his duties as an officer.Ron then goes to meet Duke  having to hide his phone voice. Duke shows clear disdain for who his bodyguard is  but retains his professional demeanor. The other Klansmen  however  are less subtle  as Felix and Ivanhoe surround Ron in an attempt to intimidate him. Ron approaches Duke to ask for a Polaroid together with him and another Klansman. He asks Flip to take the picture  and just as the camera flashes  Ron puts his arms around both Duke and the other man to anger them. Although Duke tries to come off as threatening  Ron reminds him he is a police officer and can arrest him for laying a finger on him.Duke then rounds up the Klansmen for a meeting to have Flip have his official initiation. Meanwhile  the BSU is listening to a man named Jerome Turner (Harry Belafonte) as he recalls a mentally handicapped friend from his youth named Jesse  who was found guilty by an all white jury for the alleged rape and murder of a white woman  and they only deliberated for four minutes. Jesse was chained and paraded through the streets where he was stabbed and attacked  and later castrated. This cuts between Duke spreading his message of hate and white power  while the BSU goes for justice and black power.After Flip\'s initiation  the Klan gathers for lunch. Walker tells Felix that he recognizes Flip as the cop who busted him years ago  and he knows that Flip is Jewish. Furthermore  Walker points out to Felix that it\'s Ron who\'s been speaking to them on the phone. The two of them then try to get Flip to reveal himself  but he doesn\'t budge. Ron then follows Connie  as he knows she is up to something suspicious. Felix leaves moments later with Walker and Ivanhoe  and Flip follows them.Connie arrives at Patrice\'s home to place the C4 in her mailbox  but it won\'t fit. She has to run when Patrice and her friend arrive. After they go into their house  Connie sticks the bomb under Patrice\'s car  and Ron spots her. He chases her after saying he\'s a cop  and he tackles her to the ground. Two other officers show up and naturally get the wrong idea  made worse by Connie shouting that Ron was trying to rape her. The officers start to assault Ron right before Flip pulls up and tells the officers to back off after proving Ron is an undercover cop. Felix then drives up right next to Patrice\'s car  thinking the bomb is in the mailbox. Patrice and her friend step outside after seeing Ron on the ground  just as he tries to warn them as Felix takes out the detonator. The C4 goes off  killing Felix  Ivanhoe  and Walker. Connie wails as she sees this  and she is arrested.Ron later has dinner with Patrice in a place where Landers comes in to mess with them. She brings up the harassment incident  which Landers proudly admits to  as well as spewing threats against them. Turns out Ron was wearing a wire for Flip  Jimmy  and Bridges to hear  and Landers is quickly arrested.Not long after  Ron has one last phone call with Duke  where he reveals himself as the black man that he met  and he proceeds to tell Duke off for being a racist jackass  leaving him completely bewildered.The department thinks of Ron as a hero for his success in the operation. Bridges then brings Ron  Flip  Jimmy  and Trapp into his office. He orders Ron to destroy evidence of the investigation since he doesn\'t want the public to know about the whole thing. The guys are outraged  but Ron proceed to tear up the file. The phone then starts ringing  and  thinking it might be the Klan  Ron doesn\'t answer. He starts to leave the building  but then he goes back inside to answer.Ron is in his apartment with Patrice. She breaks it off with him because she doesn\'t want to be with a cop. Moments later  they hear a pounding outside. They get their guns and walk out. They see out the window  not far from them  the Klan is burning a cross.We then cut to actual footage of the 2017 Charlotesville riots with neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching in the streets  as well as clips of Black Lives Matter activists chanting against them. There is footage of the Nazis clashing with the police  as well as videos of President Donald Trump\'s reaction to the incident  referring to the Nazis as  very fine people . Another clip shows the real David Duke with other white nationalists who feel empowered by Trump\'s words during the election. Additionally  there is horrifying footage of a Nazi running his car through a crowd of people  with the surviving victims expressing their horror at the situation. Finally  there is a dedication the Heather Heyer  the woman killed when the car struck her.The last shot is a silent image of an upside down American flag shown in black and white.' , 'Infiltrate hate.'

A young colleague walks by and whispers that she\'s older than her mother and if she\'s still doing that kind of work at her age  to kill her. Lee comments to herself that she\'ll kill her right now. Another employee tells Lee she\'s not allowed to drink at her desk and Lee tells her to  fuck off . When someone else inquires what she said  she shouts that she wants everyone to fuck off - and then realize it\'s her supervisor who promptly fires her.Lee goes to a dinner party at the house of Marjorie (Jane Curtin)  her literary agent. Marjorie is surprised to see her since Lee didn\'t RSVP. Lee notes how fancy it is that she has a coat check and then says Marjorie hasn\'t returned her calls and she has tons of ideas for new books. Marjorie tells her that the party is not for talking business and she is dismissive to Lee as a client. Lee wanders around the party and overhears Tom Clancy saying that writer\'s block is just an excuse writers use to explain their laziness and that he has stamina to bang out tons of books. Lee goes to the bathrooms and finds tons of partial rolls of toilet paper in the cupboard  some of which she sneaks into her bag. She asks Marjorie about it and is told that she wants all of her guests to have a full roll  thus discarding the tubes when they\'re getting low. Lee tells her she\'s  batshit . She then leaves the party  first stopping by the coat check to say she\'s lost her ticket but the coat on the far left is hers - she then sneaks out of the party with a new coat that she can\'t afford herself.At home  Lee watches old movies on television and is able to recite all the dialogue  having watched them so many times. She tries to feed her cat  Jersey  some shrimp but he doesn\'t respond. She takes him to the veterinarian but they are not allowed to look at her cat because she has an outstanding balance of $84 and she needs to pay it first. She offers everything in her wallet: $14 in cash but it isn\'t enough. At home  the landlord points out Lee is three months behind on rent. She mentions she just lost her job and he gives her some leeway because she\'s been there longer than he has and she\'s nice to her mother. She mentions there are dead flies in her apartment and she hopes to pay him soon so he can get an exterminator in who can take care of it.Lee ventures to a book shop that buys used books in hopes of securing more cash  but the employee is rude to Lee and only wants to buy two out of everything she schlepped over from her home. She asks him to make an offer for the rest so she doesn\'t have to carry them back but he suggests he\'ll only give them for $2. She points out he doesn\'t have to be rude to her because they actually carry her books there. When she tells him she\'s Lee Israel  he recognizes her as a writer of biographies and points out her last book on Est??e Lauder is now available in the clearance section. She yells at him and storms out.It\'s implied Lee has an alcohol problem and we find her in a gay bar drinking. An old colleague  Jack Hock (Richard E. Grant) enters and she recognizes him from some book-related party similar to the one her agent threw earlier. It\'s implied that Jack makes a living selling drugs. She complains that she\'s banned from the bookstore and that the shop owner was really rude to her. He mentions that he is banned from all the Duane Reeds in New York because he was caught shoplifting at several of them. Lee remembers that everyone at the party was talking about a handsome English gentleman who was so shit-faced  he peed in a closet  all over the guests\' fur coats. They laugh about this story and continue to hang out. They happen to run into the rude bookseller walking his dog. Jack runs into his building before the door can shut and writes down the name of someone from the resident list. When they get back to Lee\'s building  Jack says that he lives just a few blocks away. She goes inside and watches to see if he leaves  wondering if he\'s actually homeless. She finally retreats when he walks off.While at home  Lee stares at a signed letter from Katharine Hepburn - on whom she wrote a biography - and ends up taking it to a bookseller. The woman at the shop  Anna (Dolly Wells) offers her a few hundred dollars for it and asks why she\'d part with it. Lee claims she\'s not sentimental and Anna realizes she is Lee Israel  whom Katharine wrote to in the letter  and says she\'s read all of her biographies. Anna also mentions that she herself is a writer but not very good.In the library  Lee is researching Fanny Brice when she finds two letters Fanny wrote inside the book. She goes back to Anna\'s shop and tells her her cousin is a collector and wants to part with one of his Fanny Brice letters. Lee is given only $75 for it because the content is bland. When Anna gushes about Fanny Brice  Lee admits she\'s writing a biography on her - which Anna finds coincidental since her cousin has just given her a letter by her. After Anna mentions that Tom Clancy is getting three million for his new book  despite being right-wing mumbo gumbo  Lee storms into Marjorie\'s office  unannounced  and complains that Tom (her client) is getting a three million advance. She tells her agent that she\'s writing a new biography on Fanny Brice and wants a $10 000 advance so she can pay her bills. Marjorie is dismissive towards her so Lee points out one of her books was on the New York Times Best-Seller list. Her agent points out that there are three reasons Tom gets 3 million advances and she gets none - 1) she is unclean and unfriendly and her books about other people so people don\'t know her; while Tom has a sexy image and sells himself well; 2) Tom does every press interview and book signing that they set up for him to promote his books; she refused to do so; and 3) nobody wants to read a biography on Fanny Brice. She suggests Lee finds some other way to make a living.At home  Lee is typing on her typewriter but can\'t think of what to write except  This is me fucking using the typewriter.  She looks at the second Fanny Brice letter she had found but not shown to Anna - and puts it in her typewriter  adding a P.S. that says  My new grandchild has inherited my old nose. Should I leave something extra for repairs?  When Lee takes it to Anna  she is offered $350 because the P.S. is priceless. She tells Lee that there is a huge market for literary letters and if her cousin has any more to send them her way.Now that she has generated some revenue  Lee is able to pay all of her rent money  encouraging the landlord to offer to have an exterminator come over. She also takes her cat to the vet - she is told he will be okay as long as she mashes two pills into his food every day. Lee sees a new typewriter for sale and buys it - then goes home and types a letter on it pretending to be No??l Coward. She struggles to forge his signature until she realizes she can do so by holding a copy of his signature to a TV and tracing it onto her letter. Lee then takes this forged Noel Coward letter to Andre  an autograph collector who offers her top dollar for it  telling her he knows a collector who would buy it - who actually knew No??l Coward. He tells her he sells the letters to other collectors and if she has more content like this  to bring it back because he can find people who want to purchase them  both in New York and around the country.Lee now celebrates by taking Jack out to lunch. While there  Jack admits to having sold some coke which was mostly laxative. He then flirts with the young gay waiter. Lee admits to him that she is forging literary letters and that\'s how she\'s making money. He is unimpressed because he knows nothing of the literary world. At a payphone  Lee calls up the book seller who was rude to her and pretends to be a woman from the fourth floor (whose name Jack got when he snuck inside the building) and tells him his place is on fire. They laugh as  across the street  he runs out of the bookstore in a panic. The two have a fun night out at a lounge club where a trans singer performs. Lee  used to staying home alone and having no friends  enjoys being out.They get back to Lee\'s place and the landlord has an exterminator spraying the ground floor and they all head up to Lee\'s home to spray for the flies. But everyone complains that her home smells bad and the exterminator refuses to enter until she cleans it up. Lee feels embarrassed but Jack offers to help her clean it. She has been living in squalor and there are flies buzzing all around. Jack learns there is a whole pile of cat poop underneath her bed. When Jack suggests heading home  Lee questions him where his apartment is - he has mentioned several locations and keeps telling her different addresses and she realizes he has nowhere to go. So she lets him sleep on the couch  her first guest in a long while since she is used to being alone with her cat.Jack and Lee go to an autograph collectors expo and look at all the literary letters on display including some that Lee has been forging. When asked how the dealer knows it\'s authentic  he says it\'s been given a Letter of Authenticity. Another collector shows the two of them a letter from Dorothy Parker that is selling for $800. They pretend to be interested. She tells them to be careful buying from other collectors who aren\'t discriminatory about what they accept and points out Alan Schmidt (played by Melissa McCarthy\'s husband  Ben Falcone) as someone who is not discriminate. Cut to Lee selling a letter to him. He tells her there are buyers all over the country for those kind of letters.At home  Lee calls someone\'s house  asking for Elaine and is rude to the woman who answers. She then calls her agent up but is told by her assistant she\'s not available. She calls back  pretending to be Nora Ephron  and Marjorie answers right away. She calls her a starfucker and asks if it\'s one word or two.Lee buys more typewriters and each one is assigned to a different author on which she writes various letters in the voice of these authors  after researching the way they write. A letter from Dorothy Parker  in which ends up with  Can you ever forgive me  Dorothy?  she sells to Anna  who gushes about the content. She also continues to bond with Lee and asks her out to dinner  as what we realize is a romantic gesture.Anna and Lee go out to dinner. Anna is very sweet to her and talks about how she inherited the bookstore and fills her life has become mundane  unlike Lee\'s. Anna tells Lee that she should write an autobiography before she gets so famous and someone makes money writing the same story as a biography. Lee tells her nobody will care about her after she dies and her only concern is who will feed her cat whom is the one being she cares for. Lee also complains about how she has become a nobody but Anna continues to encourage her. Anna admits she brought the short story she wrote after taking a few classes which Lee said she would read and give her honest opinion about. Lee mocks her for bringing it to dinner and is so antisocial  she constantly is aggressive towards Anna  who remains sweet. When Anna thanks her for inviting her  Lee tells her she can always use another  drinking buddy   erasing any romantic implication to their date. Anna shuts down and when the night ends  they part ways. It\'s obvious Lee wishes she could be a kinder person but she doesn\'t know how.At night  Lee is reading a book by one of the literary authors whose writing she emulates  to get a sense of her style. She puts it down and contemplates reading Anna\'s story which has a note written on it  Lee... Please be kind.  She changes her mind and leaves the story unread.After Lee sells her latest No??l Coward forgery to Andre - in which she pretends No??l is writing to his secret male lover -- she gets a call on her answering machine telling her he\'s concerned about the latest literary letter he received. She goes to his store and asks what his concern is. He says he is alarmed because there is a possibility the last letter was a forgery. The collector who knew No??l says he never made any public acknowledgment of his orientation and wouldn\'t have put it in a letter. She writes this off as being a fluke but Andre tells her that one of the letters that was sold to a collector in Los Angeles was so suspicious that an entire convention devoted its time to debating whether it was authentic or not. He tells Lee that nobody in New York is going to buy from her anymore.The next time Lee sees Alan Schmidt  instead of being duped like he normally is  he tells her the FBI had reached out to him and asked him to wear a wire to expose her as a literary forger. Instead  he is a nice guy and won\'t do that - if she pays him 5000 dollars. She tells him she doesn\'t have that kind of money but he tells her she needs to find a way to get it or he\'ll inform the FBI about her scamming him. Meanwhile the FBI begins to fax every bookstore owner in town and informs them that Lee is forging letters and not to buy from her - Anna gets the fax and is crushed.Lee has no choice but to use Jack in her plans. She continues to forge letters but now Jack is the one going to bookstores selling them to the owners. Because he doesn\'t care about the literary world  he is cavalier in his stories about how he acquired them but he has such a strong history as a con artist that he is able to sell them all successfully. When Alan offers him $200 for one  he says that a place in Brooklyn offered twice as much. When the seller asks why he didn\'t just buy it for that price  he responds that he hates boroughs. Back at her place  Lee laughs that they\'re paying Alan\'s blackmail money with his own funds that he spent on forged letters. But when Lee counts the money  she realizes he was trying to short her  lying about how much he had been able to raise so far and thus taking more than the cut she promised him. Lee feels betrayed and tells him never to steal from her again.Jack tries to sell a letter to Anna but she tells him there is a string of forgeries going around and asks if she can hold onto it to have it looked at by an authenticator. When Lee learns of this  she goes crazy because if It\'s found to be a fake  it can be used as evidence. Jack suggests stealing an authentic letter and selling it for top dollar to get the $5 000. He mentions stealing a tube of toothpaste by replacing it with an empty tube so when the employee checks the shelf  they see the box and don\'t realize anything has been stolen and it\'s win/win. She says it\'s not win/win because he took the toothpaste and also points out that those letters are in museums and archives and they only let people see them for research purposes. He points out  because she\'s a published biographer  she can do that.Lee leaves the city for a few days to visit\'s Yale libraries where famous letters are held. She is explicit to Jack that he has to mash up her cat\'s medicine into his food and make sure his water dish is filled and also tells him not to sleep in her bed. Nonetheless  when she leaves  he invites over the waiter he flirted with before and they have sex in Lee\'s bed. He also neglects the cat at first but we see him mashing up the medicine into his food.At Yale  Lee presents a (forged) letter from her publisher stating her new biography is on authors who had drinking problems and she needs to see Lillian Hellman\'s box. While a security guard watches  she takes notes but is really handwriting the copy from one of those letters. She goes back to her hotel and types up a replica. The next time she does research  the librarian asks her what other authors she plans to include in the book and Lee snaps at her that she\'s got a bus to catch. Nervously she slides the fake pages from her bag and then slips the real two pages into her sock. When she leaves  she apologizes to the librarian and says she\'s anxious when she travels. The security guard checks her bag for any stolen items but  since it is in her shoe  he finds nothing.When Lee gets home  she cheerfully calls out to her cat but then finds him dead under the couch. Lee immediately breaks down. Jack enters the living room  making excuses for why he invited the young gay men over (since they were both in her bed when she arrived) and she screams at him that her cat died. He tells her it was an accident (meaning it happened at no fault to his own) and that he did what she told him to do. She screams to him to get the fuck out of her house.Lee goes to the vet who is used to her bringing her cat in since her cat was her only companion for years and years. But they notice she is holding a shoebox and broken  she tells them she needs a place to bury him because she has no backyard. The vet promises to take care of that. Lee then meets with Elaine  whom she had been prank calling throughout the film  in the park. Elaine was the one who had bought her Jersey 12 years earlier and Lee tells her he died. Crying  Lee tells her that Jersey was the only soul who loved her and now she feels alone. When Elaine suggests she get a new cat  Lee says it wouldn\'t be the same. Elaine reminds her that they broke up years and years ago because she couldn\'t handle how difficult Lee was to be around. She is not interested in reconnecting because she senses Lee is just as horrible as she always was.Now that she has authentic Lillian Hellman letters  Lee meets with Jack at the gay bar she first stumbled upon him at. She is very pointed with him and says she doesn\'t trust him because he tried to steal from her but she has nobody else who can help her get money for the real letters. She explains that because they\'re authentic  he has no reason to negotiate for price and that he should only accept top dollar. She also lambastes him for not respecting the letters explaining that they\'re not just pieces of paper but in the literary world  they\'re a link to the history of literature.Jack goes to a bookseller and sells the authentic Lillian Hellman letters for $300 each which the seller knows is grossly under-priced. We next see Jack with the FBI\'s informing them of Lee\'s crimes. They suggest he must have taken a small cut for helping her but he shrugs that accusation off.Lee continues to wait in the gay bar for Jack to return with the money he sold the authentic letters for. She is getting more and more drunk which is common for her. As she is ready to give up and leave  the FBI enters and hands her a subpoena. They also tell her she\'s not allowed to destroy any evidence that can be used in the case. At home  she rips down all her notes and gathers all her typewriters and throws them in a trash can down the street.Lee meets with a lawyer who tells her her best bet is to get a job - any job - to show she is willing to earn a living legally; to do volunteer work with children (which she grimaces at so he suggests working with animals instead); and to sign up for AA meetings. In court  he tells the judge that she now works as a copy editor at Scholastic Books  she is volunteering at a cat shelter  and she\'s going to AA. The judge asks if Lee has any comments before she hands her her verdict. Lee says she doesn\'t actually feel remorseful for what she did; she was so happy writing  using her skill as a biographer to recreate witty retorts by beloved writers. She considers it her best work. She also comments that she\'s a lonely woman and is willing to take whatever punishment she is handed down for her crime. The judge seems impressed by her authenticity and sentences her to five years\' probation and six months\' house arrest - except to go to work and AA meetings.Some time has gone by. Lee meets Jack in a bar. He now looks sickly and has to walk with a cane. He also has been given probation for assisting Lee in her crimes. She admits that she is supposed to be at an AA meeting but has still slipped out to meet with him and to drink. At home  she realizes she wants to write again and the topic will be about her own experiences forging letters - the first time she\'s writing about herself  as Anna suggested  instead of about someone else. She wants to include Jack in the book and wants his permission. They discuss his illness - it\'s implied he has AIDS and Lee tells him he did fuck his way through Manhattan - and he tells her she can write about him if she makes him 29 with great skin.Now using a computer  new technology for the early \'90s  instead of a typewriter  Lee begins writing CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME: MEMOIRS OF A LITERARY FORGER. She also has a new kitten that looks like Jersey.One day  Lee is walking past a bookstore when she sees one of her forged Dorothy Parker letters in the window. She goes inside and asks how much the owner is selling it for. He tells her it\'s $2 000  framed and mounted. She asks how he knows it\'s the real deal. He says anyone who knows Dorothy Parker\'s voice knows that it\'s really her. Lee goes home and writes a forged letter as Dorothy Parker  with Dorothy\'s caustic wit  saying she\'s writing from the grave and telling him what her final thoughts were after being cremated. The bookshop owner receives the letter and realizes he has a forgery on display in his window. He goes to the front and removes it but  after studying it over and realizing how clever the writing is  slips it back in the display.During the credits  we get updates on the people in the story. We\'re told Lee had forged 400 letters and that two of her fake letters made it into a 2007 biography on No??l Coward until they were finally removed in later reprints. Jack Hock died in 1994 and was taken in by a gay men\'s shelter at the end of his life. We\'re also told that Nora Ephron gave Lee a  cease and desist  letter to keep her from impersonating her on the phone. And that Lee\'s book  Can You Ever Forgive Me?: Memoirs of a Literary Forger  was praised by the New York Times.The film is dedicated to the memory of Lee Israel who died in 2014.' , 'Her greatest work will be her biggest crime.'

The middle-aged Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is extremely frail  constantly ill and temperamental  but has her closest ally in Sarah (Rachel Weisz)  her childhood friend and advisor. Sarah is measured and intelligent  and helps Anne make most of her war-time decisions.Meanwhile  Sarah's cousin  Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives at the Queen's estate via carriage. She is shoved by another rider on the way out and falls into filth  and when she enters the castle  the maids play a trick on her and send her to meet her cousin smelling atrocious. Abigail's father has fallen from grace onto extremely hard times and Abigail is desperate for a job. Unimpressed  Sarah gets her a job in the downstairs  where she shares a room with all the other maids. The other maids bully her  even tricking her into touching lye with her bare hands  burning her right hand.Meanwhile  Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult)  a local politician with Parliament  is desperate to stop the war. But Sidney Godolphin (James Smith) argues the opposite to the Queen  insisting that the fight must continue. Sarah  who holds the most power to influence Anne's opinion  convinces Anne to double the tax on the citizens to pay for the new phase of the war  and Harley is furious.One night  Anne has an extremely terrible attack of gout and is screaming in pain. Abigail steals a horse and goes out into the forest  picking herbs to ease Anne's pain. While there  she makes eye contact with the handsome Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) but plays coy. She lies her way into Anne's chamber to apply her remedy  but Sarah catches her and orders her to be lashed. However the remedy works and Sarah stops the beating after only a few strokes and speaks with Abigail. She's impressed and takes on Abigail as her assistant. With this promotion  Abigail gets her own room away from the other maids. Abigail reveals that previously  her father had lost her in a bet to an old German man who she was forced to be with  and she will do anything to get out of that life. Abigail also coughs loudly in front of Anne  making sure to explain she caught a cold from picking her healing herbs.Part II: I Do Fear Confusion and AccidentsAt a grand party  Harley tries to talk with Anne about not continuing the war  but can never get her out from under Sarah  while at the same time  Abigail sneaks into Anne's chambers to take books. When Sarah has a dance with Masham  Anne grows agitated and demands Sarah take her back to her chambers. She slaps Sarah  angrily  who apologizes. They enter Anne's chamber and begin to have sex  to the shock of Abigail  who flees without being seen.Part III: What an OutfitJohn (Mark Gatiss)  Sarah's husband  leaves to lead the ongoing battle in the war. Sarah is worried but resolved. Over a round of shooting  Abigail asks Sarah how she can be alright with her husband being in such grave danger. Sarah explains that she believes this is what is best for the country and she has prepared herself to pay the price; she notes that Abigail understands this  having given herself over to the German.Part IV: A Minor HitchHarley approaches Abigail and asks her to spy on Sarah and Anne  and bring him anything he can use to help him curry favor with the Queen. Abigail declares she'll do no such thing and tells Sarah about it  who is unfazed. Sarah becomes busy with matters of state and making decisions  and sends Abigail to socialize with and watch after Anne. Although Anne at first is not interested in Abigail  Abigail bonds with her by asking about her rabbits. She has seventeen  one for every child she's lost. Anne softens to Abigail  and spends more and more time with her. One evening  Sarah enters Anne's chambers and finds Abigail naked in bed with Anne  sleeping after they've had sex. Enraged  the next day she hurls books at Abigail  accusing her of being a schemer  and fires her outright from Anne's service. Abigail  shaken  takes a book and bashes herself in the face with it until her nose is bloody  then waits outside Anne's chambers and cries.Part V: What If I Should Fall Asleep and Slip Under?The next day  Sarah sees Abigail still in Anne's employ. Queen Anne tells Sarah she is not fired because she likes having her around... and likes sleeping with her. The three travel together awkwardly. Sarah takes Anne aside and tells her that enough is enough  she's made her point  but Anne confesses she likes having everyone vying for her affection.Sensing Sarah and Anne's non-wavering bond  Abigail meets with Harley  and agrees to help him  in exchange for a favor. She wants to marry Masham  with whom she has had a continuous flirtation. Harley knows she can never do that  because she's not of noble birth but promises to make it happen  and Abigail meets him in the House of Parliament  telling him that the Queen is going to double the tax  and promises to get him meetings with Anne unaccompanied by Sarah. With that information  he is able to ambush Anne before her speech and goes onto to deliver his own speech  thanking her for not cutting the tax and ending the war to which the room erupts in cheers. Pressured by that  Anne faints  unsure of what else to do. Sarah knows someone must have gotten to Harley and set them up.Abigail gets more herbs from the garden and poisons Sarah's tea. Sarah then goes out for a horseback ride  and when the poison takes affect  she passes out and is dragged violently by her horse out into the country. The whole estate is concerned about Sarah's disappearance  but Anne suspects she might be faking it for attention  jealous of her getting close to Abigail. Sarah is found bruised  bloodied and unconscious outside a brothel.Part VI: Stop InfectionWith Sarah gone  Anne is easily influenced. Harley lets her in on the fact that Abigail and Masham have been romancing one another  and Anne insists they be married. In order to make that happen  she makes Abigail a Lady. Abigail and Masham are married in a private ceremony. Then together  Abigail and Harley also weaken Anne's resolve on the issue of the war. Queen Anne also begins to worry that something serious may have happened to Sarah.Meanwhile  Sarah awakens in the brothel with a massive scar on her left cheek from her injuries. She demands to be released  and initially they refuse  but she sends word to her contacts to bring money and is let go. When she returns  she is appalled to see Abigail is now a Lady. She slaps her across the face and then returns to her chambers and finds old letters from Queen Anne.Part VII: Leave That  I Like ItSarah (now wearing a black scarf around the left of her face to hide her ugly scar) goes to Anne and tells her that she needs to continue the war  double the tax  and remove Abigail from her service and move her away from them. Anne balks  and Sarah tells Anne if she doesn't she will release to the press  the love letters that she wrote to Sarah  causing a huge scandal. Anne is deeply betrayed.Feeling guilty for threatening Anne  Sarah burns the letters however she is quickly informed that she needs to return her keys to Anne's chambers and that she is being removed from the castle. Sarah apologizes outside Anne's door  explaining she burned the letters  but Anne doesn't acknowledge her. Sarah moves to a different estate.Part VIII: I Dreamt I Stabbed You In The EyeWith Sarah gone  Abigail has free reign  and spends her free days partying with the upper class and reluctantly tending to Anne  who by this time has suffered a stroke and is partly paralyzed on the entire left side of her body. At the same time  Anne is beginning to falter on the issue of the war with Harley and Abigail constantly influencing her. Sidney wonders if Sarah would have a different opinion  but Anne balks. When he brings up the idea of Sarah sending her an apology  Anne shows some interest but behaves as if it doesn't matter to her. Sidney goes to Sarah and convinces her to mend fences with Anne and write her a letter. Sensing Anne's pining for Sarah  Abigail lies and tells her that she's looked at the books and it seems that Sarah and John were stealing from her. Anne absolutely doesn't believe her. Anne gets more and more upset waiting for the letter from Sarah. It finally arrives at the estate  but Abigail intercepts and burns it.Later  Harley is trying to convince Anne to remove John from the military. Sidney is aghast  since John just won for them  but Anne declares that John has been stealing from them and orders him removed  and the war ended. She insists that John and Sarah be banished from the country. Sarah and John are at home when troops arrive outside their place and Sarah sees them through the window.In the final scene  as Anne sleeps in her chambers  Abigail steps on one of the rabbits  pressing down on it with her foot. Anne stirs and she lets the rabbit go. Anne then orders her to come take care of her  and Abigail  subservient again  rubs the queens legs as the rabbits move around.  ,nan

Thousands of young men joined the army and were trained to fight in the battlefields of Europe. These young men were known as dough-boys.\nFrench and British had already been fighting the German army for 3 long years. They badly need help and were happy to see the US joining the war.With World War I am looming  young U.S. Army dough-boy Robert Conroy (Logan Lerman)  Hans Schroeder (Jim Pharr) & Elmer Olsen (Jordan Beck) has his life forever changed when a little dog with a stubby tail wanders into camp. Robert and his unit had paraded through town and Robert noticed Stubby and threw him a biscuit  when he saw Stubby begging for food. Stubby followed Robert into camp and met him on parade grounds.The men of the 102nd Infantry Regiment (United States)  26th Infantry Division (United States) train on the parade grounds of Yale University.\nConroy gives his new friend a name  a family  and a chance to embark on the adventure that would define a century.Sgt. Ray Casburn (Jason Ezzell) leader of Conroy's unit is very impressed that Stubby is not afraid of gunfire and is very helpful in various training tasks. Stubby can even salute the Colonel  who allows Stubby to join the army. Stubby also participates in gas mask training and learns to be wary of the gas-based weapons.\nHe also completes the basic training and the obstacle course. Conroy's unit is the first US infantry division to join the war on the ground in Europe. The colonel orders Stubby to be left behind  but train with the next batch of recruits at the base. Robert was heartbroken to leave Stubby behind.Conroy hands over Stubby to the unit's chef before leaving for Europe  but Stubby escapes and stows aboard the troop ship. Stubby reunites with Conroy by tracking the smell of his boots all over the ship and is accepted by the unit's Colonel when Stubby impressed him with his intelligence.Despite lacking formal military working dog training  Stubby and his human companions find themselves in the trenches of France in the town of Chemin Des Dames.\nStubby makes himself useful by chasing the vermin out of the trenches. Hans  meanwhile  has to put up with a lot of hostility due to his German background.\nFrench soldier Gaston Baptiste (G??rard Depardieu) befriends the duo and accompanies them along their epic journey through harsh conditions and incredible acts of courage.\nStubby digs out many soldiers from the rubble of artillery fire.Goston  Conroy and Stubby go on a spy mission close to the German positions and find that Germans are about to attack with mustard gas. They are pinned down by sniper fire and unable to return  so Conroy dispatches Stubby to warn the unit to put on masks  thereby saving hundreds of lives. Stubby also warns the nearby villagers before the gas reaches  thereby winning their trust and gratitude.\nGaston and Conroy become good friends  sharing stories of their families back home. Gaston has 3 daughters  while Conroy's sister Margaret is like a mother to him. Gaston is a good chef and wants to open a French restaurant after the war.As narrated by Robert's sister Margaret (Helena Bonham Carter)  Stubby's combat service includes sniffing incoming gas attacks  finding wounded allies in No Man's Land  and even catching a German infiltrator in the trenches.\nIn Apr 1918  the Yankee division is moved to a new battle sector in Seicheprey. Seicheprey was the single largest American battle of WW 1  as they back the Germans from advancing on Paris.\nStubby is injured and hospitalized after he saves the unit from a grenade attack.\nThe Germans continue to advance  and the allied defense line keeps getting pushed back from Seicheprey and closer and closer to Paris.Gaston is reassigned to a French unit and so Conroy is left alone. Conroy gets the flu and is also hospitalized. Conroy and Stubby eventually reunite and Conroy gets better. They are given R&R in Paris.\nThe US Airforce ruled the skies and by Sep 1918  the momentum had shifted in favor of the allies. The war was close to being over as the German army was in retreat.\nStubby is promoted to Sergeant for the capture of the German spy  and he outranks Conroy now.Back home  Stubby's exploits are retold in newspapers across the country.\nEventually the Germans surrender in face of tank attack from the US led by Captain George S. Patton (Nicholas Rulon). Nov 11th  1918  the war comes to an end. Olsen dies on the last day of combat  while Conroy and Hans come back home. Gaston meets Conroy and bids him goodbye.For his valorous actions  Stubby is still recognized as the most decorated dog in American history and the first canine ever promoted to the rank of Sergeant in the United States Army.  , 'Marching Into Theaters April 2018'   The Incredible True Story of America's Top Underdog

Her name is Katie Price  and she has Xeroderma Pigmentosum which is a rare disease that forces her to stay out of the sunlight cause sun rays can cause severe damage to her skin. There\'s a group of kids outside of Katie\'s house pointing at her windows saying she\'s a vampire that never comes out during the daytime. Next thing we see a young boy named Charlie skating by on his skateboard. The narrator (older Katie) talks about how she has such a crush on Charlie who she\'s obviously never met. One of the young kids knocks on Katie\'s door  and her father (Rob Riggle) says she can\'t come out and play cause it\'s daytime  but this girl whose name is Morgan demands to see her and says she\'ll be back later. Morgan becomes Katie\'s best friend.Fast forward to present day and teenage Katie (Bella Thorne) is graduating from high school  only she\'s been home schooled. Her dad gives her a present  and it\'s a guitar from Katie\'s mom who we find out died when Katie was very young. Katie begs her dad to let her go down to the local train station and play the guitar once the sun goes down. At night Katie can venture out and do anything like a normal person. As she\'s playing the guitar at the train station Charlie (Patrick Schwarzenegger) sees her and is struck by her singing. He goes up to talk to her  and she freaks out with nerves and packs up her guitar and runs back home  accidentally leaving her journal behind. Charlie asks Morgan if she knows who Katie is and Morgan arranges for Katie to pick up her journal at the train station the next night from the station manager. Only instead Charlie is there with the journal to surprise her. She\'s nervous again  but he convinces her to walk home and talk to him.A few days later  Katie texts Charlie inviting him to a party at Morgan\'s co-worker\'s house. The party turns out to be super lame so Charlie being a cool kid invites them over to another party that is packed. Charlie is being hit on by another girl at the party  but it\'s clear he likes Katie  and they dance  and eventually  he invites her to go for a walk where they share their first kiss on a boat that Charlie is tasked with keeping up for the summer. We then see them on a series of dates at night because while Katie has not told Charlie of her condition  she continually says  I\'m busy during the days but can come out at night.

Brown)  take advantage of the chaos by robbing a bank. They have to flee before they can open the vault  but Sherman's brother Lev (Brian Tyree Henry) steals what appears to be an ordinary pen from a teller. After blowing a hole through the wall to escape  they are found by four armed officers who exchange fire with the crooks. One of them is killed  Buke (Kenneth Choi) gets shot in the neck  and Sherman's brother is shot multiple times before they kill the guards. Sherman grabs his brother and heads to get help.The thieves go to Hotel Artemis  a secret hospital for criminals run by Nurse Jean Thomas (Jodie Foster). Sherman and his brother scan their wrists with their membership chips implanted  but Buke is denied because his won't scan. After cursing out Jean for this  she brings in her large assistant Everest (Dave Bautista) to take Buke outside. Buke tries to fight Everest  but he overpowers him and forces him to stay outside as the riots are getting closer.Nurse Jean tends to Sherman and his brother  giving them the respective code names of Waikiki and Honolulu. She treats their wounds and also tries to replace Honolulu's liver after it has sustained severe damage. He is put on life support.In other parts of the hotel are Acapulco (Charlie Day)  an arms dealer who is there because someone tried to rip his face off  and Nice (Sofia Boutella)  a French assassin who purposely hurt herself to get close to a target. He tries to intimidate her until Waikiki/Sherman  who has something of a history with Nice  intervenes. Acapulco tries to be a tough guy and threaten Waikiki  but neither of them are buying it from him.Nurse Jean receives a call from a man named Crosby Franklin (Zachary Quinto)  who demands that she treat his father  the owner of the hotel. He and his goons are on their way with the man in order for him to get medical assistance. Meanwhile  the power grid continues to go out as a result of the authorities handling the riots  so Everest has to keep switching the power back on.As the riots are growing more intense and violent  a cop named Morgan (Jenny Slate) is outside the hotel calling for Jean and begging for help  addressing her as Mrs. Thomas. Everest tries to talk Jean against letting her in  but she feels she might know Morgan. Jean grabs a framed photo of a little boy and brings it outside to show to Morgan  who identifies the child as Beau. As they try to pull Morgan inside  a couple of punks try to steal Jean's bag  but she tries to give them a few valuables. The punks are then shot by armed police officers who attempt to go after Jean until Everest shows up and beats them all to death.Back inside the hotel  Jean treats Morgan's wounds  and we learn that Beau was Jean's son who supposedly died from an overdose as a young man. After she gets better  Morgan leaves the hotel.Waikiki chats with Nice  and she reveals to him that the pen that Honolulu took is actually a portable vault containing yellow diamonds valued at $18 million that belong to a notorious criminal called The Wolf King (Jeff Goldblum). Waikiki takes the pen to his brother and shows him what's inside. He wants both of them to leave  but Honolulu is still on life support  so he says he is okay if Waikiki leaves without him. Waikiki then uses a 3D printer to make himself a gun  despite the rules against having a weapon in the building.The Wolf King and his goons arrive with Crosby and his own gang. Wolf King has an injury that needs treatment  so Jean reluctantly treats him. After fixing his wound  Wolf King reveals that he had Beau killed after he stole a car from him. Jean considers killing him in retribution  but killing patients is against the rules of the Artemis.Knowing that Wolf King is in the hotel and since he is a target for her employer  Nice kills the power at the hotel just as Acapulco is trying to catch a helicopter ride out of there. This causes Honolulu's life support to go out  and Jean cannot save him  so he dies. Acapulco's ride then flies away due to potentially being compromised. Nice finds Wolf King's room and slits his throat with a broken piece of glass. She confirms the kill to her employer using a recorder implanted in her eye. Moments later  she runs into Waikiki  who knows what she did  although she expresses remorse for Honolulu's death. Acapulco then shoots Waikiki and nearly goes for Nice until Waikiki fights him and sticks Acapulco's head in the 3D printer  which impales his head and kills him.Nice goes to fend off Wolf King's guys  as does Everest. Waikiki and Jean attempt to escape the hotel until they are found by Crosby  who has found out his father has died. Crosby attacks Waikiki  until Jean throws him medical sealant that he uses to blind Crosby  and then Jean kills him by injecting him with baby elephant tranquilizer.Waikiki and Jean make their way out  but Jean decides she has to stay to help others now that Wolf King and Crosby are dead. Waikiki parts with her on good terms before he heads off to Vegas to a different hotel called The Apache. Everest  having survived his encounter with Wolf King's mob  turns the lights back on at the Artemis  and Jean heads back inside.The mid-credits scene show that Nice has also apparently survived as she runs through the shadows.  , 'Los Angeles 2028.

The action begins in February 2010 when Philadelphia police detectives  joined by federal DEA agents (Drug Enforcement Agency) and FBI agents  make a drug raid on the Gosnell clinic looking for evidence of the sale of illegal prescriptions for controlled drugs. During the raid  the police detectives are shocked by the clinic's extremely unsanitary conditions  bags of aborted fetuses left in hallways  and fetal body parts stored in containers in a refrigerator and freezer. The detectives later learn that the State Department of Health had not inspected the clinic for years  ostensibly at the direction of the Governor so as not to interfere with women's reproductive rights. (Para) The DEA and FBI agents are concerned only about evidence of the illegal prescription sales  but the detectives refer the situation at the clinic to the District Attorney's office. An Assistant DA agrees to prosecute. Returning to the clinic crime scene  they learn that boxes of files have been removed. Obtaining a warrant to search Dr. Gosnell's home  they begin looking for the files and additional evidence. They find a large box with rolls of cash  which was likely the cash payments made by the clinic's patients. (Para) The detectives question current and former clinic workers about the clinic practices. They learn of the death of one patient on the operating table from a drug overdose and of untrained assistants giving patients anesthesia. No nurses or MD anesthetists work at the clinic. The detectives discover other violations of law  including abortions performed after the fetus/baby is 24 weeks old. Questioning clinic staff  they learn that some babies were delivered alive  after which their spinal cord was cut with scissors by Dr. Gosnell. The detectives take the stored bodies to the coroner's office  and the coroner determines that several of them had live births. (Para) A freelance investigative blogger provides additional information that helps the police and the prosecutor. She is the only journalist or member of the press in the nearly empty courtroom as the trial begins in March 2013. Dr. Gosnell has hired an experienced  forceful and effective defense attorney  who defends him for performing a service to poor and minority women seeking to terminate their pregnancies. The prosecutor obtains compelling testimony and photos from one of Gosnell's young assistants and brings in actual evidence from the clinic. (Para) After 10 days of deliberation  the jury convicts Dr. Gosnell of one count of third-degree murder in the death of one patient and three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of three babies who were born alive then killed by cutting their spinal cord. The jury also convicts Gosnell of 21 felony counts of performing illegal late-term abortions and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour consent law. The judge sentences Gosnell to three life sentences to be served consecutively with no possibility of parole.  , 'He took an oath to protect life  not take it.'

He spends time with his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) and son Danny (Dean-Charles Chapman) before boarding the train to work  frequently engaging with other regular commuters like Walt (Jonathan Banks).Michael works as a life insurance salesman. However  on this particular day  Michael\'s boss calls him into his office to tell him he is being laid off. Despite trying to argue against it  Michael is let go.Michael goes to a bar where he meets his friend  Officer Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson)  who was also Michael\'s former partner during his time as a detective. As they chat  there\'s a news story on TV about a city planner that supposedly jumped to his death several nights earlier. Michael admits to Murphy that he hasn\'t told Karen about getting laid off yet. They then find out that a former colleague that they don\'t like  Dave Hawthorne (Sam Neill)  is now captain. He comes over to chat with the men for a brief moment.On the train ride home  Michael is told by Walt that a woman is observing him. Michael sits down and is joined by the woman  Joanna (Vera Farmiga). After a brief friendly chat  Joanna tells Michael that there is a compartment on the train containing $25 000  plus another $75 000 in cash. She tells him he can have it as long as he helps find someone at the last stop at Cold Spring under the name  Prynne . Before departing  Joanna hints at knowing about Michael being a former cop.Michael looks in the designated compartment and does find the money. When the train reaches a stop  a young woman finds Michael and tries to claim the money  but Michael decides to keep it for himself. The woman then hands Michael an envelope  saying it\'s a warning. Michael opens the envelope and finds Karen\'s wedding ring. Since he lost his own phone  Michael borrows the phone of another commuter  Tony (Andy Nyman). He tries to call Karen but cannot reach her. He tries Murphy and gets the same result but leaves a message. He then hears from Joanna  who tells him he\'s made his choice and must now find Prynne  or something will happen to Karen and Danny.Michael tries to leave a message on a piece of newspaper for Walt to contact the police. Just then  Michael receives a phone call from Murphy. After Michael tells him what\'s going on  Murphy mentions that a witness using the name Prynne claims to have seen two men throwing the city planner to his death. After hanging up with Murphy  Joanna calls Michael again and directs his attention out the window. He sees Walt about to cross the street to talk to officers  but someone working with Joanna pushes Walt into the path of a bus  killing him. She warns Michael that this is what happens when he tries to weasel his way out. She instructs Michael to find Prynne and a bag that they are holding  and to put a tracker they slipped to him onto the bag.Michael observes the other passengers in case anyone is watching him. He interacts with a few who just think he\'s weird. Michael sees one young girl  Gwen (Florence Pugh) with a bag  but when he follows her  he sees she\'s carrying fake ID\'s for her boyfriend. Michael then spots one young man  Dylan (Killian Scott)  talking on the phone and carrying a bag. Michael follows Dylan  who attacks him in the next car for following him. When Michael mentions Prynne  Dylan gets suspicious  and the two continue fighting until Michael lets Dylan win so he can slip the tracker on him.A while later  Michael is called by Joanna again and he looks under the floor of the empty car. Dylan\'s body is stuffed in there with a bullet in his head. She blames Michael for this happening as he identified the wrong person. To make things worse  the police are coming after being told about disturbances on the train. Michael hides next to Dylan\'s body but gets locked in when a cop inspecting the car steps on the handle. Michael slips off of the train just as it starts up again and then rolls out from under it before running back to the train. His bag gets caught  and when he pulls it back  all the money (except for a $100 bill) flies out.As the train gets closer to Cold Spring  Michael gets more desperate. He pegs 5 commuters as potentially being Prynne since he\'s never seen them on the train before. After mistakenly thinking a man playing cards with Tony is Prynne  Michael follows a guitar player  Oliver (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith)  into the empty car. Oliver turns out not to be Prynne  but an assassin working with Joanna  sent to kill Prynne. Michael fights Oliver for a while until they break a window  with Oliver trying to push Michael out  but Michael gets the upper hand and stabs Oliver in the neck before throwing him out the window where he gets run over by another passing train. He then grabs Oliver\'s gun.With two stops remaining  Michael causes the train\'s air-conditioning to malfunction so that all the remaining passengers move to the empty car where the AC still works. He then suspects a nurse  Eva (Clara Lago)  of being Prynne. He takes her phone  thinking she is contacting Joanna  and holds her at gunpoint to tell the truth. Frightened  Eva admits she had a fight with her boyfriend and is trying to fix things up with him. Michael apologizes after realizing she\'s telling the truth.Once they reach Cold Spring  Michael slowly realizes that Prynne isn\'t anyone he suspected before. He recalls a young woman going to Cold Spring had switched seats after being next to an obnoxious passenger. The woman\'s name is Sofia (Ella-Rae Smith).  Prynne  comes from her reading  The Scarlet Letter  and its protagonist  Hester Prynne. Michael realizes that Sofia witnessed the murder and is supposed to testify with two FBI agents at Cold Spring  but since he refuses to give her up  Joanna declares via another phone call that everyone will die now.The train moves on  but Michael tells one of the conductors  Sam (Colin McFarlane) to stop the train. Sam pulls the emergency brake  but the train keeps moving because the engineer is dead. With the train set to crash  Michael and Sam try to unhinge their car from the rest of the train. Michael manages to get it loose with Sam\'s help  but the car is still attached by a chain. Sam helps Michael get it loose  but the train crashes with Sam still inside  and Michael manages to jump onto the other car  which derails and comes to a screeching halt on the outskirts of a train yard.Once everyone has calmed down  Michael asks Sofia what she might have that the villains want. She pulls out some kind of flash drive containing information that the city planner  who was a friend of Sofia\'s  might have known about. Sofia also mentions that she couldn\'t go to the police because the killers were cops. The police then arrive outside  believing that Michael has taken the passengers hostage. Murphy shows up and tries to talk Michael down. Michael helps a large group of passengers go out  with a few remaining on board. Michael tries to get Murphy to tell him what he may know about the conspiracy. Murphy mentions the phrase   There\'s no such thing as noble   which is something Joanna said earlier  cluing Michael in to Murphy\'s involvement. After admitting his guilt  Murphy takes out his gun  telling Michael he\'s got his family to worry about as well. Murphy goes looking for Prynne. When Sofia tries to reveal herself  other passengers start saying they are Prynne as well. Michael and Murphy then fight while the cops outside try to get a clear shot at Michael. Michael manages to take Murphy\'s tracker  tricking the police. Once Murphy draws his weapon  Hawthorne orders the cops to take the shot  killing Murphy.Outside  Michael is reunited with Karen and Danny after being told that agents arrested three men outside their home. Sofia meets the FBI agents and gives her testimony. The other passengers consider Michael a hero. He then talks to Hawthorne  who says they will investigate Murphy and any accomplices he may have had. Hawthorne also suggests inviting Michael back to his old job as a detective.Some time later  Michael is back on the train  and he manages to find Joanna. Although she pretends not to know him  Michael figures he\'s got her whole scheme pegged and that it won\'t work now. When she asks him how he thinks this will end  Michael simply takes out his detective badge.' , 'Lives Are On The Line'  'His Life Is On The Line.'  'Every Passenger Is A Piece Of The Puzzle.'

Before she begins with her recipe  she updates viewers on an ongoing case involving Stephanie\'s best friend  Emily Nelson (Blake Lively)  who has been missing for the last five days. Stephanie is overcome with emotion before composing herself to give new viewers a recap on what has happened.Stephanie admits she has not known Emily that long  and met her at their sons\' kindergarten recently. Stephanie is always volunteering and contributing to Miles\' (Joshua Satine) class  to the point where some other parents like Darren (Andrew Rannells)  Sona (Aparna Nancherla)  and Stacy (Kelly McCormack) think Stephanie is making them look bad. The other parents discuss their jealousy over Emily  who works in New York City for a major fashion brand as a public relations manager. After school  Miles wants to have a playdate with his friend Nicky (Ian Ho)  Emily\'s son. Stephanie first meets the sophisticated Emily when she goes to pick Nicky up  and  at the boys\' pestering  Emily agrees to the playdate and invites Stephanie to come over for drinks.Stephanie arrives at Emily\'s stylish home. She is stunned to see a graphic nude painting of Emily hanging on a wall. Emily is blunt and rather crass  even telling Stephanie to stop apologizing. Stephanie explains that she is a widow after her husband and brother were killed in a car accident. Emily\'s husband  English professor and one-time author Sean Townsend (Henry Golding)  arrives home and meets Stephanie while he and Emily kiss passionately. Stephanie says she has read Sean\'s book and enjoyed it. However  when Sean isn\'t there  Emily notes that Sean hasn\'t written a thing since the first book 10 years ago  and that they are close to bankruptcy.While taking the boys to the park  Stephanie snaps a photo of Emily for the school\'s yearbook. Emily firmly orders Stephanie to delete the photo  and does not explain why. Stephanie meekly obliges. At Emily\'s house  the two have martinis and trade secrets. Emily tells Stephanie of how she and her husband got into a threesome with Sean\'s teaching assistant a few months earlier. Stephanie then tells a secret of how  after her father passed away when she was a high school senior  she met a son he had from another relationship named Chris (Dustin Milligan). In her grief  Stephanie turned to Chris  and the two wound up having sex  leading a shocked Emily to call Stephanie a  brother fucker .Emily calls Stephanie and asks her for  a simple favor  to pick up Nicky from school because she has to take care of some work business  while Sean has gone to London to look after his injured mother. Stephanie obliges  but she can\'t get in touch with Emily. After two days  Emily hasn\'t come for Nicky. Stephanie calls Emily\'s job and is told that Emily flew to Miami to handle something  which she didn\'t mention to anyone  even Sean. Stephanie gets in touch with Sean to inform him  and he isn\'t surprised that Emily has left Nicky with her. He says that when Emily knows Nicky is with someone taking care of him  she will disappear for a few days. He returns home the next day for Nicky  and when Stephanie tells him that her assistant is unable to get in touch with Emily either  they speak to the police about Emily  who has been gone for three days. The police imply that she has left on her own because of marital troubles and Sean later tells Stephanie that Emily deleted his Facebook account once when he posted a photo of her.Stephanie takes it upon herself to find out what happened to Emily. She goes to Emily\'s work in New York City and meets her overbearing boss  designer Dennis Nylon (Rupert Friend)  who rudely dismisses Stephanie\'s concerns and insults her outfit. Stephanie sneaks into Emily\'s office and finds a black-and-white photocopy of an unflattering photo of Emily with  Gotta have faith  written on it. Stephanie is spotted on her way out of the office and Dennis threatens her  but Stephanie remembers hearing Emily speaking brashly to Dennis  and Stephanie hits back with some sass of her own to get Dennis to back off. Stephanie then uses the photo of Emily to make missing fliers. Detective Summervile (Bashir Salahuddin) later visits Sean to inform him that Emily was not on any flights to Miami but that she rented a car from LaGuardia Airport the day she disappeared.Stephanie wraps up her original video posted after Emily had been missing for five days  updating her viewers with details about Emily\'s rental car. After a few days of Emily being gone  Stephanie\'s viewership has increased  and one of Stephanie\'s vlog viewers sends her a message stating that she may have spotted Emily driving in Michigan. Authorities go by a lake where the car was spotted  and sure enough  they fish the car out of the lake  as well as Emily\'s body. Sean is called in to identify the body  and he breaks down.A funeral is held for Emily. Nicky and Miles get into a fight when Miles says that Emily is in heaven  and Nicky yells at Stephanie  claiming that she\'s trying to be his new mom  and Nicky yells at his father that he is a loser as his mother said. Sean reacts angrily but Stephanie ably defuses the situation. After the reception  Stephanie and Sean console each other  which leads to the two of them having sex.Stephanie speaks with Detective Summervile and is in disbelief when told that Emily\'s autopsy showed that she not only had severe liver damage from alcohol abuse  but heroin in her body and track marks on her arms and between her toes from injecting heroin. She informs him that the couple fought about money like most married people do. Detective Summervile also tells her that Sean took out a $4 million life insurance policy on Emily right before she died. Stephanie insists they are looking in the wrong direction by investigating Sean  and that Dennis Nylon is way more suspicious. The detective explains that Nylon contacting them telling them that Stephanie had more information than she was revealing.Stephanie goes by the college where Sean works and sees him getting very friendly with his attractive young teaching assistant. At dinner  Nicky insists he saw his mom that day at school  and when told by Sean that he merely thinks he saw her  Nicky retorts that she spoke to him and told him to say hi to Stephanie.Growing suspicious  she asks Sean about the life insurance  which Sean says was Emily\'s idea after learning that Stephanie lives off her husband\'s insurance  so they were thinking about Nicky in case something happened to either of them. He also tells Stephanie a story about the ring that was found on Emily\'s finger. It belonged to his mother and was the only piece of jewelry she cared about  and although Emily claimed she had given it to her and wanted Emily to have it  Emily in fact stole it. While visiting his mother in London  the ring disappeared  and on the plane ride back to New York  Emily announced she had found it. A relieved Sean is shocked when Emily reveals she has no intention of giving it back and actually stole it  and that there was no point for his mother to take such a beautiful ring to the grave. She tells him to choose her or his mother. They would later go into the airplane bathroom where Nicky was conceived. When Stephanie tells him she knows about his threesome  he tells her that Emily was a pathological liar and that it never happened.Shortly after  Sean convinces Stephanie to move in. After Stephanie empties Emily\'s clothes from her large walk-in closet  she is startled to see all of Emily\'s items suddenly returned to their same spots. Stephanie begins to believe that Emily is a spirit who is worried about being replaced. While she is driving the boys home from school  Nicky gives Stephanie an envelope that he says is from Emily. Stephanie opens it and finds a picture of Stephanie with her family and Chris  with  brother fucker  written on it. Stephanie then receives a phone call from Emily  mocking her  and tells her to kiss Sean 4 million times for her.Stephanie thinks back to telling Emily about the day her husband  Davis  and brother  Chris  were killed. Davis confronted her on her close relationship with Chris and his affection toward Miles  and demanding to know whether Miles was his son or Chris\'s. She tells him he is talking crazy but does not answer the question. The two men then drive off in Davis\' Camaro for a  man-to-man  talk  only to be killed. When Stephanie tearfully recounts her guilt  she and Emily end up kissing.Stephanie continues to dig into Emily\'s history. She takes the nude portrait of her  which she had said was painted by a former lover  and sees from the signature that it was painted by a woman. She tracks down the artist  Diana Hyland (Linda Cardellini)  who claims that she was once in a romantic relationship with Emily  but her name was really Claudia. Diana was on the verge of a burgeoning career and starting to sell her work before she fell in love with her. She began painting nudes of exclusively and it ruined her career. Diana says  Emily  was a con artist who scammed her out of money after Diana paid off her student loans and college debts  and then she disappeared completely. Diana then gives Stephanie the one thing Emily left  which is a T-shirt for a Bible camp called Squaw Lake in Michigan. She warns her not to investigate Emily\'s past.Stephanie visits the camp and gets old books with pictures from past campers. In the book from 1996  she finds many pictures of twins Hope and Faith McLanden. After contacting numerous people with the name McLanden  Stephanie manages to find Hope and Faith\'s mother  Margaret (Jean Smart). Stephanie disguises herself as a cleaner and then sits down to ask Margaret about her daughters. She describes the two of them as being trouble  especially Faith. Stephanie shows Margaret the picture she found in Emily\'s office and confirms that the woman in the photo is Faith. It turns out that when Hope and Faith were 16  they burned down the east wing of their home with their father inside  and the two vanished without a trace.Now that she\'s onto something  Stephanie makes a vlog calling out to Emily  forcing her to reveal herself as being alive. She  updates  her viewers about how  to get closure  she went to Michigan to find out all about Emily\'s life  sharing photos from the Bible camp. She says the photos helped her feel as close as a twin to Emily  before closing with a message to Emily is  telling her that she\'s  gotta have Faith  wherever she is.

Emily expresses her disdain that Sean had sex with Stephanie in their home  and appears to threaten Sean with a gun  only to pull the trigger and reveal the gun wasn\'t loaded.Emily meets Stephanie in the cemetery by her own grave. Emily tells Stephanie her side of the story  although a flashback reveals what Emily ISN\'T saying. Emily  who is really Hope  and her twin sister  Faith  burned the east wing of their house with their father inside because he was abusive. She notes that she was actually a triplet  but their sister Charity was stillborn. After the fire  they ran away from home and planned to meet up elsewhere  but Faith never showed up. After 16 years  Faith contacted Emily to meet up at the camp  where Emily found that Faith has become a heroin addict. Faith tried to blackmail Emily  and Emily drowned her in the lake and used her body to be found so that Sean and Nicky can get the life insurance money since they were broke. Back in the present  despite Emily stating that Faith\'s death was a suicide  Stephanie knows it was murder. Emily then accuses Stephanie of not being fully honest regarding her relationship with Chris  implying that he is Miles\'s real father. A flashback shows that Stephanie\'s husband Davis (Eric Johnson) was also suspicious as well  and that he took Chris on the car ride that ended their lives. Additionally  Emily plays a recording of her conversation with Sean in the restaurant  where he says that Stephanie meant nothing to him and that he thought of Emily during sex.Stephanie then brings in an insurance lawyer  who tells Sean that since it was discovered that Emily had a twin  the insurance company is hesitant to pay the full amount  especially since it is a large amount of money.Emily steals a wrench and tosses it into the air so that it hits her in the eye. She walks into a police station to make it look like Sean beat her and forced her to fake her death  as part of a scheme to frame Sean for insurance fraud.

Rear Admiral John Fisk (Common) sends a Virginia-class submarine  the USS Arkansas  under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass (Gerard Butler) to investigate.Jayne Norquist (Linda Cardellini)  National Security Agency senior analyst  analyzes this incident with the upcoming meeting of Russin Defence minister with Russin President Zakarin. She senses something is wrong with the timing of the attack on the US sub and recommends putting eyes and ears on the ground where the meeting is taking place.At the same time  a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman (Toby Stephens) is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base  but their mission is swiftly complicated when Martinelli (Zane Holtz)  the team's new DM recruit  is rendered unconscious during the HALO drop. When they arrive at the naval base  they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov (Mikhail Gorevoy) conducting a coup and taking Russian President Zakarin (Alexander Diachenko) prisoner  and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war.Meanwhile  the Arkansas discovers the lost U.S. submarine (due to a torpedo attack)  and also finds a sunken Russian submarine damaged in a manner that suggests internal sabotage rather than external attack. They are attacked by another Russian submarine that has been hiding under an iceberg  but Glass is able to destroy the ambush person and rescue Russian survivors from the wreck  including submarine captain Sergei Andropov (Michael Nyqvist).Back at base  the U.S. government learns about the coup. Admiral Charles Donnegan (Gary Oldman) recommends preparing for war  while Fisk (under advisement from Jayne that US is dealing with only a rouge general and the entire Russian military and hence deploying the fleet might play into Durov's hand by forcing a war) suggests that the Arkansas be sent to rendezvous with Beaman's team after they have rescued Zakarin. Glass manages to convince the reluctant Andropov to help  and with Andropov's knowledge of the minefield around the base  Glass navigates the Arkansas near the base undetected. Meanwhile  Beaman's team infiltrate the base and succeed in retrieving President Zakarin  but lose two teammates in the process. He delivers the injured president to the Arkansas's DSRV  then goes back alone for Martinelli  whom he was forced to leave behind due to prior injuries.As U.S. and Russian fleets face off for battle  the Arkansas sustains further damage when they are attacked by Andropov's old ship - a heavily armed destroyer now commanded by Sutrev (Ilia Volok)  a member of Durov's conspiracy - but Andropov is able to communicate a message affirming that President Zakarin is aboard the submarine. When Durov orders his forces at the base to fire missiles at the surfaced Arkansas  Glass refuses to take action  recognizing that firing back at the Russians could start the war he is trying to stop. In the last seconds  Andropov's old crew-mates defy orders and destroy the incoming missiles with CIWS before they can strike the Arkansas  and subsequently destroy Durov's naval base headquarters with their missiles. With the war averted  Glass docks the Arkansas to the Russian naval base to return Zakarin and Andropov's surviving crew to their country. Glass and Andropov bid farewell and confirm their respect for each other. Beaman returns with an injured Martinelli  and the Arkansas crew travels to the U.S.  , 'Courage Runs Deep'  'Start a Battle to Stop a War'

Years later  Mossad agent Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac) mistakenly kills the wrong person while hunting a Nazi war criminal in Austria  damaging his reputation.In Buenos Aires  Sylvia Hermann (Haley Lu Richardson) unknowingly begins courting the son of Adolf Eichmann  Klaus (Joe Alwyn). At dinner with her German-Jewish father  Lothar (Peter Strauss)  Klaus openly speaks negatively about Jews in Germany and claims his father died in the war. Lothar grows suspicious and passes his name along to Mossad in Tel Aviv. Field agent Zvi Aharoni (Michael Aronov) is dispatched in Buenos Aires to begin reconnaissance  presumably being offered the job over Peter.Klaus takes Sylvia to a meeting  which turns out to be a Nazi revival led by Carlos Fuldner  which Eichmann also attends. Realizing what the meeting is  Sylvia abruptly leaves  ending her relationship with Klaus.Now working in coordination with Mossad  Sylvia meets the Eichmann family at their home under the guise of reconciling with Klaus. An argument between her and Klaus causes Adolf (living under the name Ricardo Clement and claiming to be Klaus's uncle) to intervene; Klaus accidentally refers to him as his father and Eichmann is subsequently photographed. Eichmann notices the operative taking his photo and sketches him.The Mossad team uses the evidence from the meeting to confirm Adolf's identity and plan his capture - they intend to disguise themselves as an air crew and fly him out while sedated. Peter and his ex-girlfriend Hanna  a doctor  are brought on to the team with her role to keep Eichmann sedated during their travels. After capturing Eichmann  he admits his real identity  but his family realize that Sylvia found out as well  and inform the police who prevent their plane from taking off. The agents learn that the Israeli airline  El Al  will not agree to transport Eichmann unless he signs an affidavit stating he will willfully go to Israel; he refuses to sign because he does not believe he will get a fair trial. The team's interrogator is not able to get through to Eichmann  but Peter eventually does by sharing his personal story of the loss of his sister and her three young children to the Holocaust and listening to Eichmann's story about being ignorant of the actual killing of the Jews  his job being focused exclusively on logistics.During the plane's delay and while they await Eichmann's capitulation  Klaus and the police increasingly investigate Eichmann's disappearance  distributing the sketch of the operative to the public. As the Mossad team prepare to leave  Eichmann drops his polite facade and tells Peter a horrific story of watching 5 000 Jews murdered in a pit  cruelly wondering aloud if one of them (a woman who had begged Eichmann to save her infant) was Peter's sister.When one of the Mossad team is captured after using US dollars instead of pesos  she reveals the location of the safe house  and the rest of the team must escape in one car  leaving two operatives behind. The police also confiscate the plane's landing permits  grounding it.

Jordan) scores a string of victories  culminating in a victory over Danny  Stuntman  Wheeler (Andre Ward) to win the WBC World Heavyweight Championship. Now a worldwide star  Adonis proposes to his girlfriend  Bianca Taylor (Tessa Thompson)  who agrees to marry him. When Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles  Adonis is reluctant to leave his life in Philadelphia behind.Meanwhile  Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren)  a former Soviet boxer who killed Adonis\' father  Apollo Creed  in the ring thirty-three years earlier  sees an opportunity to regain the glory that was taken from him as a result of his loss to Rocky Balboa in Moscow later that same year by pitting his son  Viktor Drago (Florian  Big Nasty  Munteanu) (with the assistance of Buddy Marcelle (Russell Hornsby)  a promoter who has followed Viktor\'s career closely)  against Adonis. When Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) refuses to support Adonis\'s decision to accept Viktor\'s challenge  Adonis  feeling betrayed  decides to leave for Los Angeles.Adonis and Bianca settle down in a luxurious apartment in Los Angeles close to Adonis\'s adoptive mother  and Apollo\'s widow  Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad). As Adonis and Bianca adjust to their new life on the West Coast and prepare for the upcoming match with Viktor  Bianca learns that she is pregnant. Adonis recruits Tony  Little Duke  Evers (Wood Harris)  son of his father\'s trainer and later Rocky\'s trainer as Mickey\'s replacement. Overwhelmed with all the recent developments in his life  Adonis rushes into the match  getting himself badly injured. Viktor is disqualified for hitting Adonis while he is down allowing Adonis to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Viktor becomes extremely popular in Russia and wins a series of fights given top billing.His body and ego shattered  Adonis becomes increasingly disconnected from Bianca. Mary Anne reaches out to Rocky in hopes of having him come to help Adonis out of his slump; Rocky arrives  he and Adonis make up  and Rocky agrees to train Adonis (with Little Duke) properly for a rematch against Viktor  who is suffering near-torturous levels of physical tests by his father. Bianca gives birth to a baby girl  and they name her Amara. Adonis and Bianca\'s fears are realized when their child is born deaf  inherited from her mother\'s progressive degenerative hearing disorder.While Viktor continues to taunt Adonis publicly  he is constantly pressured by his father to regain their honor. Ivan appears to be enjoying the attentions of the media and various Russian delegates  with which Viktor appears uncomfortable. At a State Dinner  he and Ivan meet Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen)  his mother  and Ivan\'s ex-wife  for the first time in several years after she abandoned both of them after the loss to Rocky. Viktor is immediately enraged at the sight of his mother and chastises Ivan for his interactions with the people who outcast them. Back in America  Rocky and Little Duke take Adonis to a decrepit location in the California desert to retrain  describing it as a place where fighters are reborn. Adonis undergoes a rigorous and brutal training regimen with Rocky and Little Duke  focusing on fighting from the inside and training his body to repeatedly absorb the heavy impact he knows he will receive from Viktor in the ring.The rematch in Moscow is considerably more balanced as a more controlled and focused Adonis exchanges equal blows with Viktor. Since Viktor is accustomed to winning all of his fights by knockout  his fights have never lasted beyond the fourth round  something that Adonis uses to his advantage as he endures Viktor\'s punishment deeper into the match  even after his ribs break again. In the tenth round after being knocked down again  Adonis unleashes a furious rage  managing to land sequence after sequence of effective blows  knocking Viktor down twice. Ludmilla  who had been sitting ringside with some of Viktor\'s supporters  departs when the tide of the fight shifts in Adonis\' favor  knocking Viktor off-balance emotionally.Ivan notes this as well  coming to terms with Viktor\'s earlier statements on the fair-weathered nature of the same supporters who had run Ivan out of Russia. With Viktor cornered and receiving multiple strikes without defending himself  but unwilling to go down  Ivan throws in the towel  conceding the fight to Adonis to ensure his son isn\'t seriously injured or killed. Though Viktor is ashamed  Ivan assures Viktor it is okay that he lost  and embraces him. As Bianca enters the ring to celebrate with Adonis and Little Duke  Rocky rescues himself from joining them  telling Adonis  it\'s your time   and takes a seat to watch them from outside the ring.Viktor and Ivan are later training together back in Ukraine. Rocky travels to Vancouver to make peace with his own estranged son  Robert (Milo Ventimiglia)  and meets his grandson Logan for the first time  noting how much he looks like Adrian.

He panics because if he ends up in Holland  that is where he will wake up tomorrow. He calls Rhiannon and asks her to rescue him. Rhiannon comes for him in her sister\'s car  knocking off the driver\'s side mirror while trying to escape Michael\'s mother. Rhiannon is upset that A left her alone at the cabin when he\'d promised to come back. A explains he couldn\'t come because the girl whose body he woke up in was getting a lung transplant that day  and he hadn\'t woken up until the evening. He also wasn\'t allowed near any cell phones.Rhiannon is in the car with her sister Jo  who asks her what\'s going on. Rhiannon tries to tell Jo about A  but Jo doesn\'t believe her. Jo tells Rhiannon she doesn\'t care what sort of weird poly-amorous thing Rhiannon is doing  just leave her car out of it (Jo\'s mad about Rhiannon breaking the car mirror). At school  Rhiannon\'s friend Rebecca asks her about the rumors she heard of Rhiannon hooking up with a random guy who left her in the woods without a truck. Rhiannon blows up at Rebecca. Later that day  Rhiannon sees A  who\'s now occupying a suicidal girl\'s body (Kelsey). A tells Rhiannon that Kelsey has planned out her suicide in detail  and will probably try to kill herself as soon as A leaves her body. Kelsey\'s father works late and won\'t be home in time to stop Kelsey.Rhiannon urges A to  push back  and try to stay in Kelsey\'s body long enough for the father to come home. The scene cuts to Kelsey\'s father coming home  and Kelsey (A) telling her father she needs help.At school  Justin\'s friends are calling Rhiannon a slut. Rhiannon ignores them and meets A in the girls\' locker room. A tells her he can\'t be with her after school this time because it\'s the girl\'s anniversary dinner with her boyfriend. At home  Rhiannon sees her mom and tells her that dad\'s changed  but so has she  so please can the two parents grow closer again.A wakes up in Alexander\'s body (Rhiannon\'s lab friend)  and tells Rhiannon what a great guy the real Alexander is.

Rhiannon happily agrees  not noticing that A is quiet and seems like he wants to tell her something. That night  A tells her their relationship has to end  but that the real Alexander is perfect for her. Rhiannon is upset  but A tells her that it\'s not right. Alexander has a family who loves him  and it\'s not fair to Alexander for A to keep occupying his body. A also tells her their relationship is blocking Rhiannon from finding the right guy for her.

Matias shows Amaya the progress he made with his software program \'Papaya \' which translates speech into ASL videos. However  Amaya remains disappointed that Matias spent time on a shortcut instead of directly learning sign language to speak with her properly. The call drops and Matias is unable to get Amaya back.Matias participates in a webcam game night with his friends Damon Horton  AJ Williams  Lexx Putri  Serena Lange  and Serena\'s girlfriend Nari Jemisin  all of whom are in different locations. While the six friends remotely play Cards Against Humanity  Matias works on reconnecting with Amaya as well as dismissing repeated messages sent to a Facebook account registered to \'Norah C. IV.\'To everyone\'s delight  Serena and Nari announce that they got engaged. The news is tempered by the revelation that Serena\'s mother is still in the hospital suffering from cancer.With Matias\' laptop plagued by persistent technical problems  Damon recommends scanning the hard drive for hidden files. Matias finds a massive archive of videos collected from various surveillance cameras and hacked webcams organized by address.Amaya finally calls back. She and Matias discuss their communication issues.Facebook user \'Erica Dunne\' sends repeated messages to the Norah C. IV Facebook account until Matias finally responds. The person on the other end reveals that he is not actually Erica Dunne  but the man whose laptop Matias stole. Matias ultimately confesses that he stole the computer and tells the man he will return it to where he found it.Before the laptop can shut down  Matias receives a message from \'Charon 68\' asking to discuss a custom job in a secret online location called \'The River.\' Matias looks up \'Charon\' to discover he was the mythological ferryman of Hades who escorted the dead across the river Styx. As the other friends finally see what is happening on Matias\' screen  Matias admits that he stole the laptop because he wanted a better computer to complete his Papaya program. Matias realizes he stole the computer from \'Charon 4 \' as \'Norah C. IV\' spells his name backwards. Matias also discovers that Charon 4 has a cryptocurrency account containing ten million dollars in bitcoin.Seemingly believing he is speaking with Charon 4  Charon 68 commissions a snuff video of a victim dying from trephination. Matias immediately turns off The River.Matias digs deeper into the hard drive to find a folder labeled \'Contributions.\' The six friends are shocked when Matias finds apparent snuff videos of a woman named Agatha chained up in a warehouse as well as a woman named Samantha drowning in an acid bath. Charon 4 intentionally shows part of his face to the camera in the most recent video depicting his kidnapping of Erica Dunne  whose Facebook account was used to contact Matias.Matias reestablishes contact with Amaya\'s computer  but Amaya\'s roommate Kelly greets him instead. The other feeds go dark and Amaya\'s screen begins glitching as Charon 4 enters the apartment and kidnaps Kelly. Charon 4 tells Matias that he will release Kelly if he gets his laptop back  but will kill her if Matias warns Amaya about what is happening. Charon 4 also threatens to kill Amaya if Matias tells any of the other friends or if anyone disconnects from their webcam game session. Charon 4 explains that Matias must find a way to make Amaya come to him so that Charon 4 can follow her to Matias\' location.When the other feeds come back  Matias tries explaining to his friends that he has been working on an immersive horror game and everything they witnessed was part of an elaborate prank. Although they have numerous questions  Matias eventually convinces everyone that he fabricated everything. After much imploring  Matias also convinces Amaya to come to his place just as Charon 4 instructed.While game night resumes for everyone else  Matias verifies that 17-year-old Erica Dunne is a legitimate missing person. Acting on an idea from Damon  Matias drains the ten million dollars from Charon 4\'s bitcoin account. Matias tells Charon 4 that he will only return the money if Erica Dunne returns home safe. Charon 4 warns that The Circle of Charons will never allow what Matias is asking.Suspecting that Charon 4\'s account was hacked  The Circle forcibly pulls Matias into The River and demands that he recite their code to prove his identity. Fearing that they will both be killed if The Circle discovers his laptop was stolen  Charon 4 shows Matias his face and tells him what to type.The Circle demands to know why the bitcoin account was suddenly drained. Posing as Charon 4  Matias claims he was merely switching to another form of cryptocurrency. More Charons join the anonymous group call as Matias is questioned.Having suspected something was off about the videos Matias claimed weren\'t real  Nari confirms that Erica Dunne really is missing. Meanwhile  the other friends notice that Lexx is away from her computer. A YouTube video suddenly plays on everyone\'s screens showing a Charon pushing Lexx off a building\'s roof.Because Charon 4 hacked Amaya\'s phone to monitor Matias  Matias directs Amaya to take the subway so that her signal will be lost. During the service interruption  Matias frantically explains that everything the friends have witnessed is in fact real. Matias further explains that to keep everyone safe  they must pretend as though nothing is wrong when Amaya\'s signal comes back.Once the Cards Against Humanity ruse resumes  Damon gains admin access to Matias\' laptop to hack the computer from his London location. Pretending to leave for a different reason  Nari makes her way to the subway to meet a friend on the LAPD.Charon 1 hacks AJ\'s YouTube channel. Charon 1 splices a series of voice clips into a threat that he phones in to 911. Additionally hacking AJ\'s computer speakers to simulate a shotgun pump  Charon 1 tricks responding officers into breaking down AJ\'s door and violently shooting him to death.Charon 4 realizes that The Circle knows he lost his laptop. Charon 4 claims that everyone will be killed  including him.A Charon presents Serena with video feeds of Nari waiting for a subway train and Serena\'s mother in her hospital bed. The Charon demands that Serena choose which woman should die  but Serena refuses. Serena\'s mother dies when her life support system is remotely deactivated. A Charon pushes Nari in front of a subway train  although Nari manages to pull the Charon with her. Serena is then murdered in her home.Damon threatens to expose The Circle\'s cabal as he continues downloading the files from Matias\' laptop for evidence. The Circle has Damon watch as they edit the Erica Dunne kidnapping video to put Matias\' face over Charon 4\'s. Damon realizes that The Circle planned for the laptop to be found all along so that they could frame the friends for the Charon crimes. Charons plant Erica Dunne\'s unconscious body in Matias\' apartment after Matias leaves to look for Amaya.A Charon infiltrates Damon\'s London flat and hangs him. The Charon then forges a suicide note confessing that the friends committed the murders.Matias then gets a call from Amaya outside an unfamiliar location asking where he is  saying he changed the meeting spot. Matias realizes the Circle has hacked his messages to make Amaya go to the factory from an earlier video. Before he can warn her to run away  the Circle hack his phone and launch the Papaya app  making it tell her to go inside. The call is forcefully hung up  and it cuts to a camera feed inside the factory. Matias watches Amaya get attacked by a Charon  presumably to torture or kill her for another video. Broken  Matias asks the Circle why they did all of this  and they repeat a clip of him earlier saying  After all  it is game night   revealing that this is simply entertainment to the Circle members.The Circle members launch a poll to decide Matias\'s fate. The camera switches as Erica Dunne wakes up in Matias\'s apartment and goes to the computer  begging for help. She pulls a cork out of her forehead to reveal the hole in her skull from trephination and freaks out before the video cuts off. A camera feed of Matias in the road is added as the poll finishes with the Circle deciding his death. As he looks at his phone  he is run over by a Charon in a large van. With their job done and their crimes pinned on Matias and his friends  the members of the Circle at each death scene go to their cameras and take off their masks  smiling  including Charon IV (whose apparent anger and paranoia demonstrated to Matias earlier in the film were clearly just an act to keep the game going)  as it is revealed that the audience\'s point of view was actually from a Charon\'s computer.\nAlternate ending (a.k.a Buried Alive)\nIn the second ending  Matias texts Amaya to meet him in a familiar spot; where he filmed a video of them hiking and sharing a kiss. He arrives at the site and finds a hole dug in the ground with an open casket  before a Charon knocks him out.Later Amaya arrives and the hole has been filled. She calls Matias and his ringing phone wakes him up. He realizes that he has been buried alive and tries to text Amaya about his predicament but the Circle changes all of his messages to:  I wish I could sign better.  When he attempts to video chat  the Circle pixelates his mouth so Amaya cannot read his lips. Amaya gets mad and hangs up  leaving Matias to die as he runs out of air.' , 'From the producer of Get Out  Happy Death Day and The Purge.'  'Dare to Enter.'  'Death wants some Face Time.'

Their latest mystery brings them to the Natural History Museum where they must rescue a group of captured gnomes from Sherlock\'s arch-nemesis  Moriarty (voice of Jamie Demetriou)  here seen as a weird pie-baby mascot.

They immediately hop on the case and set out to find clues. Based on the pattern they have uncovered  Sherlock believes this to be the work of Moriarty. His hunch is proven correct when they find Moriarty\'s calling card with the letter M on it.Gnomeo wants to make a grand romantic gesture for Juliet by finding her favorite flower  a Cupid\'s Arrow Orchid  as the centerpiece in their new garden. With Benny\'s help  Gnomeo finds a nearby flower shop that sells it. Unfortunately  he ends up triggering the alarm after Juliet sees him through Benny\'s camera.

Watson explains to them about Moriarty and how he\'s playing a game with Sherlock.Sherlock\'s clue leads the group to a Chinese antique shop. As they look for the next clue  the group angers a bunch of ceramic cats when Gnomeo accidentally knocks over their empress  and they are chased out  but Sherlock manages to find the next clue inside a cuckoo clock stuck to a toy plane before they have to escape.The clue brings them back to the Natural History Museum  but Sherlock believes they are meant to go to a gallery. He splits up with Juliet while Gnomeo stays with Watson. The two are stalked by a gargoyle in the museum. He chases after them  capturing Gnomeo and causing Watson to fall to his apparent demise  which Sherlock and Juliet see. Still  they proceed to the gallery to find the clue  but they both realize how much they took their respective loved ones for granted.The gargoyle brings Gnomeo to a hideout where all the other gnomes are being kept and are all partying.

318.205231,2018,A Quiet Place,17,90,7.5,3508,20180406,0,1,0,0,0,0,1, 'Day 89Amid the many  tattered missing persons fliers; a family quietly tiptoes barefoot through an empty store of a ghost town. The family\'s mother  Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt)  carefully looks through a cluster of uncollected prescription bottles for her eldest son  Marcus (Noah Jupe)  who is sick. Evelyn gives Marcus some medication and uses sign language to reassure her Deaf daughter  Regan (Millicent Simmonds)  that her brother is okay. Regan then checks on her younger brother  Beau (Cade Woodward)  who is drawing a picture of a rocket on the floor. He signs to Regan   Rocket. That\'s how we\'ll get away.   then climbs the mostly empty shelves and reaches for a space shuttle toy. The toy falls from the shelf  but Regan scrambles to catch it before it hits the floor. Meanwhile  the family\'s father  Lee Abbott (John Krasinski)  has scavenged some electronics for a radio which will boost its signal as well as some cutting pliers for Regan. Evelyn signs to her family that  It\'ll be dark soon  and they prepare to leave when looks of horror come across their faces. Beau has the electronic space shuttle toy in his hands which Lee carefully takes from him removing its 2 AA batteries. He signs to his youngest son   It\'s too loud.  As the family departs  Regan sneaks the toy back to Beau who then grabs the batteries on his way out. The Abbotts silently walk back home on a trail of sand they\'ve created. As they come to a walking bridge  they suddenly hear the electronic sound of the space shuttle toy from Beau who is pulling up the rear. A horrified Lee races back toward his son  but it\'s too late  an alien creature quickly seizes and kills Beau.Day 472The Abbotts are home on their family farm. Lee is in the basement of the farm house where he has set up an extensive surveillance system of cameras and monitors as well as his radio and electronics which he uses in the hope of contacting any other survivors. There are also scores of various news clippings which report of an alien invasion  as well as notes from Lee that read   blind    attack sound   and  armour . Evelyn  meanwhile  is in a cellar where she hangs a mobile she has crafted. Evelyn is pregnant. She sets up an oxygen tank which is connected to an infant breathing mask. It sits next to a covered  sound-proof baby crib. Lee has moved up to the top of his grain silo where he looks through pictures of Beau.Evelyn asks Regan to tell her father that dinner is ready  which she reluctantly does. After silent prayer  they eat quiet foods on leaves of lettuce instead of plates. Afterwards  Regan and Marcus play Monopoly when he accidentally knocks over a lantern which sets the rug on fire. Lee quickly puts it out  and they quietly wait for the consequences. It seems as though they\'ve dodged a bullet but then hear a loud noise on the roof. Lee looks out the window and is startled  but relieved  to see a raccoon fall from the roof. He heads down into the basement to work on a cochlear implant processor which will help his daughter hear. Evelyn comes down where they share a smile and a set of ear buds as they slow dance to Neil Young\'s Harvest Moon.Day 473While Lee is pouring down more sand on their walking paths  Evelyn is in the cellar checking her blood pressure. Her due date is just a couple weeks away. She places a stethoscope to her abdomen revealing a strong  healthy heartbeat. Regan enters the house being careful to walk only on the marked parts of the floor which don\'t creek and wants to go down into the basement  but her dad stops her. He has added small amplifiers from a stereo to her new cochlear implant processor and wants to put them on Regan  but she stops him and signs that they never work. Lee  disheartened  hands them to her instead and starts to set out on an excursion. He wants Marcus to come with him  but the boy is scared and doesn\'t want to go. Instead  it\'s Regan who wants to go  but Lee tells her to stay and take care of her mom. She runs to her room and tries on the new cochlear implant processor. When they don\'t work  she\'s devastated. Regan packs a bag which includes her cutting pliers and a wrapped object from her dresser  then leaves the farm.Lee has taken his son to the river where he teaches him that making small sounds is okay as long as louder sounds are nearby. Next to a waterfall they can speak freely to each other w/out fear of being heard. Marcus asks his dad why he didn\'t let Regan come and if he blames her for what happened to Beau  because she blames herself. When Lee says it was no one\'s fault  Marcus tells him if he still loves her  he should tell her. During this conversation  Regan has arrived at the walking bridge where a makeshift memorial has been constructed for Beau. She unwraps the object from her dresser which we discover is the space shuttle toy  then uses the pliers to cut a wire which enables the toy to light up w/out making any noise. Back at home  Evelyn is carrying a laundry bag up from the basement when it gets snagged on the stairs. She manages to pull it loose causing her to fall and exposing the point of a nail sticking up from the stair.On the way back home  Lee and Marcus are startled by an old man coming out of the woods  and then notice the dead body of his wife on the ground nearby. Lee implores the old man to stay silent  but instead he lets out a primal scream. Lee grabs Marcus and runs as the man is quickly scooped up and killed by an alien. Back home  Evelyn\'s water breaks. She heads down to the basement and impales her foot on the exposed nail coming up from the stair. She manages not to scream out  but drops the picture frames she was holding which draws an alien into the house. Evelyn pulls her foot off the nail  switches on the red light-bulbs which run across the property and serve as a warning signal  and searches the shelves for a mechanical kitchen timer. The alien slowly walks down the stairs into the basement listening for any evidence of life. When the timer goes off  the alien attacks it as Evelyn runs upstairs. She sees another alien in the front yard. Evelyn goes upstairs into the bathroom and sinks into the tub. She\'s starting to give birth as the alien comes upstairs.Lee has returned home and is horrified to see that the red lights have been switched on. He signs the word  rocket  to his son. Then tells him   I need you to make a sound louder. You can do it.  Lee grabs his shotgun as Marcus sprints to a designated area and lights a fuse which sets off a series of fireworks. Lee searches the house and walks into the bathroom where he sees an empty bathtub covered in his wife\'s blood. He starts to weep believing Evelyn is dead  then discovers that she is safe and hiding in the shower w/ their new baby boy. Marcus  meanwhile  is walking back toward the house when he hears an alien. He makes a run for it into the cornfield  but runs straight into a tractor wheel  knocking himself unconscious.Regan has returned home and notices the beam of Marcus\' flashlight coming out from the cornfield  but cannot hear the alien coming up behind her. But as the alien moves closer  Regan\'s cochlear implant processor starts producing a high-pitched feedback which distresses the alien causing it to run off. Regan finds Marcus and they retreat to the top of the grain silo. Lee has taken Evelyn to the cellar and placed his new son into the sound-proof crib. Evelyn thinks about Beau and regrets that she didn\'t carry him on that fateful day  then  before getting some much needed sleep  makes Lee promise that he will protect their children. Lee leaves to look for the kids as we see water rushing down into the cellar. Later  Evelyn wakes to find that the cellar has flooded. On top of this  an alien has climbed down inside the room  and the baby is sleeping in the sound-proof crib but the top is open. Evelyn carefully picks up her baby and slinks to the back of the cellar behind the waterfall flooding the room.On top of the silo  Marcus signs   Don\'t worry  he\'ll come for us.  but Regan shakes her head replying   He\'ll come for you.  All of a sudden a hatch on the top of the silo breaks causing Marcus to fall inside of it. As he\'s slowly drowning in the grain  the alien in the cellar w/ Evelyn is drawn out by the noise. The hatch breaks away completely and falls into the silo just missing Marcus. Regan  herself  jumps into the silo and successfully saves her brother by pushing the hatch towards him so he can grab hold of it. However  she herself quickly sinks into the grain. Marcus climbs onto the hatch and pulls out his sister to safety. Regan and Marcus both sit safely atop the silo door  but then they hear a crash on top of the silo. The alien from the flooded cellar jumps in the silo as the kids cover themselves with the hatch door. They seem doomed until Regan\'s cochlear implant processor once again lets out a piercing feedback forcing the alien to crash out the side of the silo.Regan and Marcus crawl out of the silo and into a pickup truck. Lee has arrived on the scene and grabs an ax  but is quickly attacked by the alien which causes Marcus to scream. Upon hearing this  the alien heads for the truck and starts ripping it open. This time when Regan\'s processor starts its piercing feedback  she turns it off. Now the alien can safely resume its attack on the truck. Lee  who is badly injured  makes eye contact with his daughter and signs   I love you. I have always loved you.  He then lets out a yell to sacrifice himself and save the kids. They put the truck into neutral and roll it back to the house where they reunite with their mother.Evelyn and the kids hear the alien approaching  so they retreat back into the house and head down to the basement. Regan  who was never allowed down there  sees (for the first time) the evidence of all the work her father put into repairing and creating her cochlear implant processor. She is overwhelmed with emotion just as the lights begin to flicker. The alien walks down into the basement and has them cornered. Regan  however  scans a handwritten scribbling from her dad which read   What is their weakness?   then takes a quick glance at the hearing aids on his workbench. And Eureka! She switches on her cochlear implant processor creating feedback  and causing the alien to shudder. Regan then amplifies the feedback by holding the processor up against a microphone. The alien collapses then slowly staggers back up on its feet  but Evelyn has grabbed Lee\'s shotgun and blows its head to pieces. When they see on the surveillance monitors that this little brouhaha has seemingly brought every alien in the county to their home  Regan turns up the speakers while Evelyn pumps the shotgun wearing a wry grin on her face.Written by:\nR.Z.

Just as they near their target  their plane is shot at by enemy soldiers. The surviving men jump from their plane before it explodes  and they land in the water before swimming to land.Private Ed Boyce (Jovan Adepo) reunites with Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell). Boyce spots Eldson being found by a group of Nazi soldiers and sees as they execute him. Ford keeps Boyce quiet as they move and find Tibbet (John Magaro)  Chase (Iain De Caestecker)  and Dawson (Jacob Anderson). They walk toward their mark  and Dawson accidentally steps on a land mine that blows him up. The others keep moving into the woods as they spot a French woman named Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) walking by. Ford orders them to run after her since nobody can know they are there. The men catch up to her  and Boyce speaks to her in French to let her know they mean no harm. Chloe reluctantly lets the men follow her back to her home.Chloe leads the soldiers into her village when a neighbor hears her and calls to the German soldiers for her being out past her curfew. Chloe talks to the Germans while the American soldiers stay hidden. She brings them back to her house where she lives with her kid brother Paul (Gianny Taufer) and Aunt Simone (Eva Magyar)  who is terribly ill and is heard making an unpleasant and loud wheezing sound. The men hide up in the attic. Paul wants to play catch with Tibbet  but he coldly brushes him off before he and Chase go check out the rendezvous site. Outside  German soldiers take a man and woman outside and execute them. Chloe says this is what happened to her own parents.Chloe tends to Boyce's bullet wound as she explains what happened to her family. Boyce also plays with Paul a little bit. Moments later  more German soldiers arrive for an inspection. They are led by Captain Wafner (Pilou Absaek). Boyce has to hide again as Chloe lets him enter her home. Wafner attempts to rape Chloe  but Boyce comes out and attacks Wafner  and the soldiers keep him tied up in the attic.Ford sends Boyce out to find the rendezvous point. He comes across the church where the tower is located  but he is nearly spotted and is forced to hide in a truck filled with corpses of the other paratroopers. Boyce finds himself inside the church  and he comes across a laboratory where he sees a number of horrific discoveries  such as the head of a woman separated from her body but still speaking to him  as well as a bag with a barely living thing inside. Boyce hides and sees the mastermind  Dr. Schmidt (Erich Redman)  entering. Boyce finds a fellow paratrooper named Rosenfeld (Dominic Applewhite) and pulls a massive needle out of him to save him. Boyce also takes with him a needle containing some kind of experimental serum before he and Rosenfeld flee.Boyce brings Rosenfeld back to the attic and shows Ford the serum. He questions Wafner as to what it does  but he refuses to say anything  so Ford starts beating the crap out of him. Boyce explains to Ford what he saw in the church  so Ford starts to devise a proper plan to make their way in and take the tower down.Ford orders Chase to go upstairs to untie Wafner so that he can get them inside. Wafner then attacks Chase and grabs his gun  shooting him repeatedly. Everyone runs upstairs to subdue Wafner  but while they try to help Chase  he ends up dying. Boyce grabs the needle and injects Chase with the serum. He soon comes back to life  but very quickly  he displays signs of enhanced strength and disorientation. Chase then starts to mutate horrifically and become violent. He attacks his comrades  forcing Ford to shoot him repeatedly. This doesn't kill Chase  so Boyce has to smash his head to bits in order to kill him for good. Wafner says that is what the serum does and is essentially being developed by the Nazis to reign supreme for a thousand years. Wafner then manages to escape as his comrades are outside  and he kidnaps Paul and gives him to the soldiers. Ford and his men fire at the Germans  and Wafner gets half his face shot off as he gets out. Ford then decides they have to take down the tower immediately  with Paul's rescue being second priority. Boyce and Chloe don't like this  so they plan to rescue Paul first.Wafner returns to the lab and finds Schmidt. To Schmidt's horror  Wafner takes two needles with serum and injects himself  causing a rapid mutation and making him grow increasingly mad.The Americans use a German soldier that they strapped with explosives to make their way into the church. Tibbet and Rosenfeld stay outside killing soldiers while Boyce  Ford  and Chloe head inside. Chloe is almost attacked by a soldier who tries to get her killed by one of the mutated people. The mutant kills the soldier and goes after Chloe  but she burns him to death with a flamethrower. She manages to get Paul out  but they still come under fire by the Germans.Tibbet manages to get Paul through the gunfire  but is wounded himself. Meanwhile  Boyce and Ford encounter Schmidt and the mutated Wafner  who attacks them. Boyce fights Schmidt as he tries to stab him  but Boyce manages to kill Schmidt. Wafner then gets Ford and impales him on a meat hook. Boyce distracts Wafner as Ford frees himself and injects himself with the serum to fight Wafner. Before Wafner can get Ford  Boyce throws a tank and shoots it  causing an explosion. Boyce tries to help Ford out  but he chooses to stay behind and ensure that the laboratory is destroyed along with the tower. Ford gets an explosive ready as Wafner prepares to attack. Boyce runs out as Ford detonates the explosive  killing himself  Wafner  and every last mutant in there as the whole place goes down. Boyce reunites with the others outside and confirms that Ford is gone  while Chloe tends to Tibbet's bullet wound.In London some time later  Boyce reports to his superiors on the mission  stating that Ford chose to detonate explosives from inside the tower to ensure that it went down. He also chooses not to mention a thing about the lab or the experiments. The superior then tells Boyce that he and his men will be reassigned.  , 'Stop the unstoppable.'

He tells Ethan that Ethan should have killed him when he had the chance. There is a fallout all of a sudden and Ethan wakes up from his dream.\nFollowing the capture of Solomon Lane  the remaining members of 'Syndicate' have become known as 'The Apostles' and Ethan receives a message about one of their members called John Lark set to buy 3 plutonium cores from black arms dealers in Berlin  Germany and how John also had a Russian nuclear weapons specialist captured (Ethan did). At the buy  Ethan poses as John Lark but things don't go well when Luther is taken hostage with Ethan choosing to save Luther and the 3 plutonium cores go missing.\nEthan then interrogates the weapons specialist in the hospital while he is watching a CNN news story of the plutonium cores having caused an attack on Jerusalem  The Vatican and Mecca. The specialist agrees to give Ethan the code to his laptop to track John Lark if John's testimony about there being no peace without first a great suffering being read on CNN. After this occurs  the specialist gives the code with it turning out that the whole CNN news story was faked and no attacks have occurred as of yet. It is revealed that Benji was posing as the news reporter and they were not in a hospital but a facility made to look like one.TITLE SCREEN.Ethan finds out about John set to buy the plutonium cores from a woman called the 'White Widow' at a gala in Paris  France. She runs a charitable organization which in secret deals weapons and nuclear arms. CIA agent August Walker accompanies Ethan to Paris in order to keep an eye on him due to having lost the plutonium cores in Berlin. Using a CIA Cargo plane  they plan to HALO jump into Paris  undetected. On board  they do not get along too well and Walker insists on jumping despite Ethan's warnings about the storm. During their jump out of the plane  Walker - ironically - is struck by lightning but Ethan manages to save his life after providing him with his own oxygen and the 2 successfully manage to land.\nAt the gala  they find John Lark with the intention of Ethan stealing his face and voice to pose as him for the white widow. Lark ends up fighting back at them in the toilets however where Ilsa unexpectedly shows up and kills Lark by shooting him in the face. With no face to make a mask  Ethan then goes to the white widow pretending to be Lark with Ilsa warning him that if he does  he will die as many operatives are in Paris to kill Lark. Ethan is successful in winning the widow's trust and they manage to escape from the assassins sent to kill Lark with help from Walker and Ilsa.\nIt turns out that the widow only has 1 plutonium core and that for the other 2 cores  Solomon Lane must be handed to her courier (who is working for The Apostles) in London  England. The only way to do this is extract Lane from a police transfer whom since being captured  has been interrogated and interviewed by many governments around the world. Ethan surmised that all police officers have to be killed in the process  which shocks him inside. However  Ethan agrees to the deal pretending that he has no line (since he is posing as Lark).\nDuring the event itself  Ethan takes the help of the widow's men  including her brother. However  Ethan changes his plan without informing such that no cop has to be killed. Lane's van is pushed into the water and Ethan and Walker drive away while being chased by the police. In the meantime  Benji and Luther extract Lane underwater. Walker and Ethan switch from their truck to motorbikes which they already set up and while Walker manages to get away  due to technical difficulties  Ethan's cover is blown. However  he manages to escape and the team now has Lane under their custody. When they come out into the open  a cop lady finds them in an awkward moment. The widow's men catch up with them and shoot the cop and then point their guns at Ethan for betraying them. Ethan quickly makes a decision and kills those men and saves the cop's life. They proceed to take Lane to the widow in their car when a mysterious person on a motorbike targets them. This turns out to be Ilsa who ends up revealing that she is being forced to kill Lane by British intelligence due to all the secrets he has on them. Ethan has no choice but to evade her so as to keep Lane alive. They manage to find a tracking device planted in Lane and take it out.\nEthan manages to have Lane abducted to await exchange of him to the widow's courier for the 2 cores. Walker provides documents to Salone with a theory on how Ethan might in fact be John Lark based on losing the cores in Berlin as well as pretending to be Lark in Paris as a means to frame him. The team then get ready to have Benji take on Lane's appearance and voice due to not intending to actually hand him over. However Agent Hunley is already waiting for them at their hideout who says the operation is a failure and is a trap. Ethan disagrees and wants to continue on. An argument breaks. It is revealed that there is no courier but that the widow is actually a CIA employee who needs Lane to buy her good will following several bad calls in the past. Walker is then shockingly revealed to be in allegiance to Lane and the real John Lark when he states to a captured Lane how the deal was for him to get all 3 cores in exchange for framing Hunt meaning he already has the 2 cores to begin with. It turns out Walker has confessed this to Benji and not Lane which has also been recorded. Salone  who has been hearing all of this through Hunley's phone says she does not trust anybody anymore and sends her men to get them. However  some of those men turn out to be Walker's men and a gunfight pursues. Ilsa manages to catch up at this point and is also dragged into the fight.\nWalker ends up killing IMF director Hanley and escapes along with Lane. However  Luther smartly implanted a tracker on Walker giving Ethan a chance to to pursue Walker. He catches up but Walker reveals that if Ethan does anything  Walker will kill his wife. Walker then escapes in a chopper with Lane.\nBased on their tracking device they implanted in Lane (which they did when they took the other one out)  the team find out he is headed to Kashmir. Benji also discovers that if 1 core (bomb) was to be disarmed  the other would immediately begin countdown. After eventually arriving in Kashmir  Benji finds out that the only way to disarm the 2 bombs is by removing the key from the remote detonator but only after the countdown on both cores has been initiated. Disarming the 2 cores before the key has been removed will result in the cores going off. They also realize that based on the location of the 2 cores  Walker plans to wipe out the entire water supply of China  Pakistan and India and cause 1/3 of the world's population to starve. They head to a medical facility in Kashmir which is where they track Lane but Ethan instead finds his wife Julia and that she has also remarried.\nLuther and Julia manage to find the 1st core and after the 15 Minute countdown begins  they begin to disarm it with Benji and Ilsa going after the location of the 2nd. Two helicopters take off from Kashmir with the detonator being in the possession of Walker. Ethan manages to grab onto the payload of the 2nd helicopter and climb up to the inside where he takes out both the driver and his guard and takes control of the helicopter. A lengthy chase then occurs with Ethan pursuing Walker whom is in the other helicopter. Ilsa manages to find the 2nd core but is knocked out and tied up by Lane whom also takes Benji captive. She manages to break out and knock out Lane as well as save Benji and the 2 of them begin to disarm the 2nd core. Ethan manages to ram Walker's helicopter and also causes the hook on his helicopter to set off steam from his helicopter which disfigures him. The 2 then take part in a fistfight at the edge of a cliff. Walker being naturally beefier than Ethan gains the upper hand. Ethan uses momentum to counter which results in them hanging off the cliff by holding on to the helicopter rope. Ethan manages to have the hook hit Walker in the face where he falls along with the helicopter and dies. Ethan then removes the key from the detonator 1 second before Benji and Ilsa disarm the 2nd core.\nSalone arrives there with her men and save Ethan. Lane is once again captured and taken to MI6 and Julia thanks Ethan for giving her the life she currently has based on his willingness to do good.  , 'Some missions are not a choice.'

-0.114119,2018,Death of a Nation,6,109,4.1,1005,20180803,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,  The film begins and ends with a comprehensive exploration of the real roots of fascism from Hitler to Gentile and Mussolini  who considered themselves progressives and uses recreations to show what policies these dictators were observing in the United States  which ones they emulated  and which political parties in the United States were responsible for and supporting of those policies.Starting with the suicide death of Hitler for the main title sequence  Dinesh D'Souza then begins the movie with his youth in India  his curiosity about history  and moves to his love of America  asking if America is threatened by new movements such as AntiFa.The premise of the film is that Democrats targeted Lincoln: He won a contested election. They went to war to defeat him. In the end  a Democrat assassinated him. Appearing in the movie as well as doing its narration  director Dinesh D'Souza suggests now that a similar target of the Democrats is President Trump and his supporters and asks if Trump can save the nation.Through a series of interviews with experts on fascism  anti-fascism  the rise of Hitler and Mussolini  visits to historic sites with dramatic recreations  including the decisions made to announce the revolution  how Margaret Sanger's Eugenics push for ethnic cleansing influenced the Reich's decisions how to determine and identify Jews  covers Mengele and the Nuremburg trials and then suggests the definition of Fascism and the Nazi Party was intentionally revised by progressives to make them appear to be right wing concepts. With the help of historians and experts on fascism  the filmmakers posit that  with its acts of violence  AntiFa is behaving more like the very fascist ideologies they claim to hate.The movie asks  which is the party of the slave plantation? Which is the party that invented white supremacy? Which is the party that praised fascist dictators and shaped their genocidal policies and was in turn praised by them? Is fascism now institutionally embodied on the right or on the left? Director D'Souza interviews Alt-Right icon Richard Spencer who acknowledges he is a socialist and not a conservative Republican.In its section on American slavery  Death of a Nation explains the roles of figures like Woodrow Wilson  Van Buren  and FDR and suggests that racism comes not from the conservative right but rather from Democrats and progressives on the left. The movie reminds the viewers which ideologies led to the election of Abraham Lincoln and which parties continued to fight for racial inequality  going so far as to create the KKK to ensure blacks didn't vote  and creating Jim Crow laws to keep them separate and unequal.The filmmakers claim at the movie's conclusion that Trump  while not in the least like Abraham Lincoln the man  is facing an extremely similar resistance from the Left  starting with a narrowly won vote  continued attempts to unseat him and a rising tide of violence and resistance to keep him from perpetuating his vision for continuing American excellence.There are two songs included in the movie. At a midpoint in the movie  O'America is sung by the director's wife Debbie D'Souza and the Battle Hymn of the Republic is the closing song  sung by Angela Primm and a gospel choir.  , 'Can we save America a second time?'

A woman is urging the guests to go inside the church because the wedding is about to start. A couple of people make comments to her about hearing Liam singing on the radio. The woman agrees that it\'s wonderful  but right now they are going to see him marry her daughter.The bride  Josie (Jessica Rothe)  is inside  getting ready with her bridesmaids. Four older Southern ladies watch the activity from a couch  enjoying the excitement. Josie\'s brother enters the room and asks her if she\'s ready for him to walk her down the aisle. A few minutes later two groomsmen come in and  after telling Josie she looks beautiful  one of them (Mason) asks to speak to the maid of honor in the hall. As they whisper outside the room  Jose is sure something is wrong but everyone assures her it\'s all fine. Then her friend returns and tells her that Liam is not coming.Cut to eight years later  an aerial view of a stadium in New Orleans  the marquee reads  LIAM PAGE TOUR.  Liam (Alex Roe) is on stage  finishing up a concert packed with adoring fans. After the last song  he walks off stage and makes a comment to his manager (Sam) that he wants a girl from the front row. Sam says they\'re already on it  but first Liam needs to get to the after party and meet with some label reps. Liam tells him he isn\'t going  and to send the girl and a gallon of vodka up to his room.The next morning Liam wakes up  and the girl is standing in his hotel room  singing one of his songs. She gets so excited to see him awake; she steps on his phone that is lying on the floor. Liam freaks out  jumps out of bed  pulls on some clothes and runs barefoot out of the hotel room with phone in hand. Downstairs at the concierge desk  fans take pictures as he asks where the closest phone store is. After receiving directions  he runs down the street  barefooted  to the store. Fans are taking videos and pictures and chasing him.When he gets to the store  he announces that he will give $10 000 to the person who can fix his phone. Several starstruck employees surround him before the store manager comes out and takes Liam into his office. The manager fixes his phone  commenting that it\'s a classic. The old-style flip phone is being held together with duct tape. When he hands the phone back to Liam  he says there must be some very important messages on there for Liam to want it fixed so badly. Liam says   just one.  Left alone in the office  Liam accesses the saved message - from Josie.When Liam returns to the hotel  Sam is waiting - furious that Liam took off and videos of him running down the street in his bare feet are being played all over the TV and internet. Liam lies down on the couch and tells Sam to get him an espresso. Then he notices a news story on the TV. Mason  his groomsman from the opening scene  has been killed in a car accident. Liam just stares at the TV in disbelief.Later  Sam is trying to get Liam to the airport so they can get to the final concert of the tour. While alone in the car  Liam tells the driver he\'ll pay him $1 000 to get him out of there. They peel out of the parking garage.In the next scene  Liam gets out of the car in front of the St. Augustine church  telling the driver that he better leave and not to tell anyone where he is if he wants to keep his job. Liam walks to the door of the church but doesn\'t go in. He sits on the steps and listens as the preacher talks about what a good man Mason was. His head is down  and he turns away from the door  bumping into Josie and a young girl who are rushing into the service. Josie and Liam lock eyes  but then she grabs the girl  and they go inside the church. She sits next to her brother and tells him that Liam is there. Her brother is obviously not happy about it.Later  Liam watches the cemetery burial from a distance. When the graveside service is over  Jose tells her brother to take her daughter so she can go to Liam. He doesn\'t want her to  but she does anyway. She walks up to Liam and punches him hard in the stomach  walking away without saying a word. Doubled over on the ground  Liam looks up and sees the preacher.  Hi Dad   he says.Liam stays at his dad\'s house  but there is palpable tension between them. His dad is bitter that Liam has not been home in 8 years and hasn\'t had any contact since becoming famous. Liam wants to know if there\'s a car he can use while he\'s there and his dad tells him that his bike is still in the garage. His dad leaves for work  telling him that he\'ll make dinner if Liam sticks around that long.Liam calls Sam and  asks him for credit cards and if he can buy a car. At first  Sam is really upset because Liam missed the concert and no one knows where he is. His publicist is sending out press releases making up stories to explain his absence. Liam tells him that his friend was killed and he\'s in his hometown. Sam softens and tells him he will take care of everything.Liam gets his bicycle out and heads into town to buy alcohol. The clerk at the store mentions that she went to high school with him and appears disgusted that he doesn\'t remember her. He takes the bottle and the bike and sits down on a bench. Just then  he notices Josie going into a flower store across the street  so he follows her.Josie is not pleased to see Liam  and he tries to be apologetic  and they exchange awkward small talk. She tells him that the flower shop is hers  that she bought it a few years back  saying that she\'s done pretty well for herself on her own. The door opens and a woman with a couple of kids  including Josie\'s daughter  come in. Josie tries to get them out of the store  but Liam starts talking to the girl. She tells him that she\'s seven and her name is Billie (same name as Liam\'s mom). She also says that she knows who he is - he\'s the country singer from the radio that her mom listens to sometimes. Josie asks her friend to take the kids for ice cream so she can talk to Liam. She confesses that she found out she was pregnant two weeks after he left her at the altar. She tried to contact him  but he never called back  and she promised herself that if he didn\'t call back  she would never try to contact him again.Liam goes back to his dad\'s house  where his dad is making dinner. Liam is angry  yelling at his dad for not telling him he has a daughter. Dad gets angry back and says  I did tell you!  Liam asks him what he\'s talking about  and Mr. Page tells Liam how he tried to call many times  but Liam wouldn\'t answer  so then he flew to Seattle to see him in person at a concert. He convinced security to let him backstage  but Liam was so strung out he told his dad to leave and never come back. He had decided then that Josie & Billie would be better off without him in their life. Liam doesn\'t remember any of it and seems embarrassed by his behavior.The next day  Liam returns to the flower shop and asks Josie if he can get to know Billie. He assures her that it will be on her terms  but that he deserves the chance to get to know his daughter. She reluctantly agrees.Later  Josie and Billie are sharing waffles  and Josie says she wants to talk to her about her father. Billie says  he seemed nice.  Josie is shocked that Billie picked up on the fact that Liam is her father. Billie says they were too obvious  and he seemed very surprised to find out about her. She then suggests to Josie that they invite him for dinner.Liam wants to buy something for Billie but is so used to other people doing everything for him  he has to call Sam to find out how to order something online. He tells Sam that he has a daughter and he\'s nervous and scared. Sam tells him he\'s going to be great.At dinner  Josie\'s brother is also there and is still being stand-offish with Liam. Next to Billie is a huge teddy bear  twice as big as she is. Liam is awkward  but Billie puts him at ease and then tells her mom to open her present. Josie opens the box  and it\'s a beautiful necklace. Billie asks Liam if he wants to see her room and meet her pet rabbit. In her room  they talk  and she says she\'s afraid to take the rabbit out of the cage because it might scratch or bite her. Liam asks if he can  and they sit on the floor with the rabbit. Billie tells Liam that he should pick her up from school the next day so they can get to know each other.After dinner as Liam gets ready to leave  Josie gives the necklace back and says she can\'t accept it. She also tells him that Billie doesn\'t want things from him  she just needs to know him. Liam tells her that Billie asked him to pick her up at school. A little unsure  she finally agrees and tells him to meet her at 3 pm.Sam has a convertible Mustang delivered  so Liam has a car  so the next day he goes to meet Josie and Billie at the school. He and Josie talk about how they went to the same school  and Liam teases Josie that he doesn\'t know what a car seat is when she gives it to him. Just then  Mason\'s widow calls Josie  and she\'s not doing well  so Josie leaves to help her out. Liam greets Billie when she gets out of school  but Billie refuses to get in the car - reciting the low survival rates of crashes in convertibles. Liam finally calls his dad to pick them up.Back at his dad\'s house  Liam  and Billie bond some more while his dad makes dinner. Billie brings out Liam\'s first guitar  given to him by his mom  and together they start to improvise a melody. When his dad burns himself in the kitchen  Liam jumps up to help. Billie picks up the guitar and starts to play  to the men\'s amazement. Liam asks how long she\'s played guitar and she answers that it\'s the first time; she just watched what he did. He tells her that he\'s going to take her guitar shopping.Things are going well  and Liam is enjoying the time he\'s spending with Josie and Billie. One night Josie even lets Billie stay the night with Liam. As Liam is tucking her in  Billie asks him why he left her mom. After a short hesitation  he says that he was confused and young and dumb. He knows it was wrong  but he was lost and didn\'t know how to handle fame. Josie and Liam\'s dad listen from the porch and the other room as Liam and Billie talk. They are both moved by Liam\'s honesty. Billie tells Liam he\'s back home now.After Billie goes to sleep  Liam & Josie talk on the porch. When Josie stands up to leave  she realizes she\'s a little tipsy and asks Liam to drive her home. When they get to her house  she tells Liam that she wants something from him: to go on a date with The Liam Page - the famous country singer. He asks her if she is ready for that and she says yes  so he agrees.We see Josie getting dressed in a very fancy dress  Billie helping her with her lipstick. A stretch limo pulls up to take Josie to Liam. The driver tells her that Mr. Page wants it to be a surprise. He takes her to a field where Liam is waiting with a helicopter. They fly to New Orleans and are mobbed by press and fans. One reporter asks Liam who the beautiful woman is and he replies  She\'s the one.  They have a romantic night and kiss on the dance floor.One afternoon they are having a get together with friends  and Liam & Billie are pretending to be lions  tearing into the  bloody meat  (hot dogs with ketchup). Josie\'s brother arrives and realizes that Billie is choking. He rushes over to help while Liam stands back  frozen.

With only about 15 minutes left before the judge lets Moriarty free  Holmes and Watson are held back when their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson (Kelly Macdonald) brings them a package from Moriarty. They open it and find a supposedly deadly mosquito flying around the room. Holmes and Watson smack each other to kill the bug until Holmes deduces in his head that at the proper angle  he can squash the mosquito without damaging the glass case of bees it is perched on. Holmes splats it  but his theory is wrong  and the case breaks  releasing the swarm of bees upon the room.The judge is about to let Moriarty free until Holmes and Watson arrive in the nick of time. Holmes gives his testimony  concluding that the man standing trial is not guilty because it is not Moriarty. He is someone named Jacob Musgraves  set up to take the fall for Moriarty  and Holmes states that he could not have carried out any murders that Moriarty is guilty of because Musgraves has a tremble in his hand caused by too much wanking  and that the real Moriarty is heading to America. Inspector Lestrade (Rob Brydon) argues with Holmes that letting this man free will only lead to more murders  but Holmes brushes off Lestrade\'s warnings.Holmes and Watson are invited to Buckingham Palace by Queen Victoria (Pam Ferris).

Peter joins his family  cousin Benjamin Bunny (voice of Colin Moody) and Peter's triplet sisters - Flopsy (voice of Margot Robbie)  Mopsy (voice of Elizabeth Debicki)  and Cotton-Tail (voice of Daisy Ridley) - as they prepare to head into the garden of Mr. McGregor (Sam Neill).The rabbits enter the garden and steal some of McGregor's vegetables before the man spots the rabbits and tries to handle them violently. They are saved by McGregor's neighbor Bea (Rose Byrne)  an animal lover and painter. She brings the rabbits into her home where she gives them water with blackberries. Flopsy (being the narrator) mentions that Bea's paintings aren't great  but the drawings she made of the rabbits are actually well done (and in the style of the original books). However  they bring up painful memories  as the drawings reveal that Peter and his sisters lived with their parents until their father went into McGregor's yard and was killed before being made into a pie. Bea looks after the rabbits since their mother is gone too.Peter runs back to McGregor's yard because he left his jacket there  which belonged to his father. He gets it and starts to leave  but McGregor traps Peter and prepares to finish him  until nature finishes McGregor first with a heart attack. After his body is taken away in an ambulance  Peter is ecstatic and invites all the animals to McGregor's house since it is now vacant and they can eat and do whatever they want.In London  McGregor's great-nephew Thomas (Domhnall Gleeson) works at a toy store where he makes sure everything is in tip-top shape and is eagerly awaiting a promotion. He is called in to speak to the store's general manager  who informs him that Mr. McGregor died and his house goes to Thomas  who didn't even know he had a great-uncle. After learning that his sought after promotion has been passed onto another employee  Thomas loses it and starts to wreck the store in a fit of rage before he is fired. However  he later learns that the house can be refurbished and put on the market  so he plans to sell it and build his own toy store to rival the one he previously worked at. He takes a cab to the countryside to find the house.The animals have a party in the McGregor house and make a huge mess before Thomas arrives. Everyone runs and hides  just as Thomas enters and sees the mess. He sits down on the couch and finds Pigling  causing them both to scream and forcing the animals to run out of the house.In the morning  Thomas starts to clean up the house. He then starts to close off any opening into the garden  much to Peter's dismay. Bea walks over to introduce herself and insists to Thomas that he leave the gate open for the rabbits to roam freely. She also gives him a pair of binoculars for bird-watching as a gift. Thomas agrees with her on the gate until she walks away and seals it off completely.Peter recruits Benjamin to join him as they find a way into the garden. Thomas spots them and attempts to catch them. He ends up grabbing Benjamin and stuffs him into a bag. Thomas goes to dispose of him  so Peter and his sisters sneak onto his truck to rescue Benjamin. They succeed and put the binoculars in the bag. Thomas accidentally drops them into the river  forcing him to jump in and retrieve them.Thomas drives into town to find supplies to handle his pest problem. He grabs what he needs and almost hits a snobbish couple on his way out of the hardware store  before running into Bea. He gives her a lift home while the rabbits attempt to ride back on the truck  only to get thrown out when it starts moving too fast. They manage to hop back on  and Peter notices with jealousy that Bea appears to be growing fond of Thomas.Thomas and Bea spend more time together  which upsets Peter because he always saw Bea as a mother figure. Peter enters Bea's painting room while Thomas is there  leading her to think that Peter and Thomas are getting along. When she's gone  the two start fighting until Peter accidentally uses a brush to paint over one of Bea's paintings. She gets upset and makes Peter stay outside.The animals start to get back at Thomas by setting up rabbit traps in his bed as well as planting rakes and hoes for him to step on so that he hurts himself. In turn  Thomas sets up traps around the yard  including an electric fence he smears with peanut butter in case they are tempted. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle goes for the peanut butter  causing her to get electrocuted (non-fatally) and shoot quills at the other animals. Peter and his sisters retaliate and rewire the electricity so that it shocks Thomas until he passes out in the garden.When Thomas gets up  he sets up dynamite in the rabbits' burrow to get them out. Later on  the rabbits attack Thomas in the garden by pelting him with vegetables until Flopsy gets him in the throat with a blackberry. Luckily  he had an epipen on him. Thomas then grabs several sticks of dynamite and lights them before throwing them at the rabbits. Bea can't hear because she's playing music and painting. Moments later  she steps out because she thinks she hears something. The detonator falls out of Thomas's pocket  and Peter picks it up to prove he was using explosives after he denies it to Bea. Unfortunately  they forgot about all the dynamite in the burrow  which causes the tree on top of it to fall on top of Bea's painting room. She is angry at Thomas for what he's done.Thomas sadly goes back into London and manages to get his job back after putting his house on the market. However  Peter feels terrible for what happened since Bea is upset. When he finds out she plans to leave  Peter and Benjamin head into town with a street mouse they meet and eventually locate Thomas at the toy store. He sees the rabbits and chases them into an employee closet. Peter then starts speaking to Thomas and apologizes for what he did and asks for his help in getting Bea to stay. Thomas decides to form a truce with Peter and he leaves the store for good.After a long journey back to the countryside  Thomas stops Bea just before she leaves in a cab. Thomas apologizes for what he's done and says that Peter helped him get back. Bea doesn't believe him until Peter takes out the detonator from his jacket and hands it to Bea. She forgives him  but Thomas is unable to return home because a couple has bought the house - the same snobby couple he encountered in town at the hardware store. Peter and his friends do what they do best and spring their traps to send the couple running away.In the end  Thomas and Bea get together and head back to London with the rabbits where Bea makes illustrations for children's books  including a few stories on Peter and his friends.  , 'You think you know him?

Suddenly  Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) burst in and announced that there were monsters on the train. He held a match under Frank\'s nose  making him freak out. All the monsters ran and jumped onto the roof of the train  with Abraham in pursuit. Reaching the last car  Dracula pushed the rest of the monsters off to safety before Abraham cornered him. Dracula turned into a mouse just as the train entered a tunnel  and Abraham got smacked. With the train exiting the tunnel  Dracula turned into a bat and flew off  with Abraham giving chase in a biplane. Dracula kept dodging his attacks  always making him crash in painful ways. Finally  Dracula made Abraham fall into the ocean.In the present day  Dracula is hosting a monster wedding at the Hotel Transylvania. The groom is ready  but the bride is still in her room. Mavis (Selena Gomez) is with her  getting her over the jitters. She tells the bride that you only zing once in your life  and if she zinged when she first saw her fiancee  then she has nothing to worry about. Reassured  she goes down and joins the ceremony. After the wedding vows are done  Tinkles  a giant dog  burst into the room  being ridden by Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) and Winnie (Sadie Sandler). Dracula orders Tinkles to sit  and leads him out on a leash. Later  Johnny (Andy Samberg) is DJing the reception and everyone is dancing  except Dracula  since he has nobody to dance with. Suddenly  Frank\'s cousin grabs Dracula and starts dancing with him. He zaps the DJ table  causing a fast song to start playing  then hides behind Bigfoot\'s leg. Frank asks him if he liked her  and he says that he didn\'t zing with her.Alone in the attic  Dracula tries to use his phone to look for a date  but it keeps mishearing what he wants. Mavis walks past and hears him through the door as he uses the ZINGR app to look at pictures. Unable to swipe correctly with his long fingers  he accidentally connects with a witch when Mavis pokes her head in. He cuts off the call  and Mavis says he\'s been working too hard. She goes to her room and cuddles with Johnny and the kids  when a commercial comes on the TV  advertising a monster vacation.In a rickety old plane  Dracula  Mavis  Johnny  Frank and Eunice (Fran Drescher)  Wayne and Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their pups  Griffin  Blobby (Genndy Tartakovsky) and Vlad (Mel Brooks) are all riding toward the Bermuda Triangle. Dennis and Winnie had secretly stowed Tinkles in the luggage compartment. The plane crash lands and everyone gets out and makes their way to an aircraft carrier. The crew leader  Stan the fish man (Chris Parnell) greets them  and the cruise sets off. Griffin  traveling with his invisible girlfriend  Crystal (Chrissy Teigen)  sees Dracula looking unenthusiastic. The ship\'s captain  Ericka (Kathryn Hahn) greets everyone in multiple languages  and Dracula\'s face freezes. She walks up to him and tries to talk  but he can only speak gibberish. His friends try to snap him back  and he tells them that when he saw her  he zinged.Later that night  the monsters are dancing  swimming and doing other fun activities. Blobby  feeling seasick  changes colors and vomits  producing a Baby Blobby (Genndy Tartakovsky) who hugs him. Wayne and Wanda see a room labeled Kid\'s Club  and they happily drop off the pups for the day. In her stateroom  Ericka greets her great-grandfather  Abraham Van Helsing  who is now in a wheelchair. She tells him that he was right  monsters are disgusting  and she wanted to kill Dracula the first time she talked to him. He tells her to be patient  and doing research  he read about the ultimate device  one that destroyed the city of Atlantis. He tells her to lure them all to Atlantis  and he\'ll use the machine to kill them all.Still determined to kill Dracula  Ericka hides and takes many shots at him  but he always manages to just avoid her blows  not even realizing what\'s happening. Meeting his friends  he tells them that he always thought you could only zing once in your life  and he already had with his late wife  Martha. They all jump in the pool and start a game of volleyball when Ericka\'s voice comes on the speakers and tells them they\'ve arrived at their first destination  the underwater volcano. They all grab scuba gear and jump into the volcano. Ericka fills a vessel with wooden stakes and chases after the group. Dracula hypnotizes a shark  and he and Dennis ride it around  with Ericka still secretly following. She tries to shoot wooden harpoons at him  but keeps just missing. Seeing the vessel  Dracula grabs the tail end and poses for a picture from Mavis. Panicked  Ericka launches herself out. Looking at the picture  Mavis sees what looks like human feet in the corner. Reaching the surface  Ericka sputters and gets back on the ship. Frank  Murray and Griffin are also on board getting snacks  when they hear Ericka muttering. Keeping themselves hidden  they hear her vow that she\'s going to get Dracula. Misunderstanding her  they think she\'s in love with him too.With everyone back on the ship  the guys run up to Dracula  and then see that Mavis is with him. Fearing her reaction to hearing about Ericka  they lead him away  and then tell him that Ericka likes him. Just then  Ericka walks up and listens in as they ask if he\'s going to ask her out. At first  she\'s disgusted  but then she realizes she has an opportunity. Pretending she just walked up  she greets him and says she\'d love to go on a date. Arriving at the next destination  the deserted island  Dracula volunteers to take Dennis  so that Johnny and Mavis can enjoy themselves. At a restaurant  Mavis asks Johnny if he noticed Dracula\'s been acting weird  and he tells her that Dracula has a crush on the captain. Taken by surprise  Mavis says that she never imagined him with anyone except her mom  but she does want him to be happy. In the cantina  Ericka orders guacamole for Dracula  then secretly dumps garlic oil on it. She takes a chip  dunks it in the guacamole and feeds it to him. He swallows  and then his stomach starts to rumble. He asks if there was garlic in the food  and she lies and says she doesn\'t know. She asks if that\'s deadly for him  but he says that it only makes him gassy. He tells her he\'s nervous  since he hasn\'t been on a date since his wife died. He explains that he built the hotel so that he and Mavis could have a safe place to live. Touched by his obvious love for his daughter  she replies that she never knew her mother or father  and she was raised by her great-grandfather. Growing up on the ship  she tells him that it was always expected that she\'d be captain one day. He says it\'s important to honor the past  but to make your own future. Thinking about that  she realizes that she doesn\'t want to be on the ship forever.Mavis and Johnny walk up to the table. Panicked  Ericka realizes she lost focus on her mission  and she quickly excuses herself. Mavis reminds Dracula that he was going to spend time with Dennis  and he hurries off to find him. Sitting down at the table  Mavis tells Johnny there\'s something she doesn\'t trust about Ericka. Johnny eats a chip with guacamole  then warns Mavis that it\'s loaded with garlic. Mavis realizes what Ericka is up to. Wayne and Wanda  still relieved to be pup-free  are running around the deck. Ericka hides from them  and is surprised to hear Abraham\'s voice coming from a vent. He tells her he knows she\'s been trying to kill Dracula  and that it could blow the whole plan. Making another lap  Wayne and Wanda run up to them  and Abraham quickly puts tranquilizer darts in their necks  and they fall to the ground  unconscious.Arriving at Atlantis  they all go into a casino. Eunice makes Frank promise not to gamble  since the last time he did  he lost an arm and a leg. Dracula asks the guys if they\'ve seen Mavis  and he tells them that he\'s going to tell her about Ericka. Mavis and Johnny see Dracula on the floor  and she notices that he\'s following Ericka around. Suspicious  she tails after them  and Ericka goes into a hidden room. Arriving at a pool  she takes off her clothes  revealing a wet suit she was wearing underneath  and dives in. Dracula follows her  unseen  and she emerges at the ruins of a palace. At the end of a hallway is a strange glowing device  and she makes her way to it. She steps on a stone and sets off a booby trap  sending an ax flying toward her head. Dracula quickly grabs the ax and tosses it aside. She realizes that he\'s been following her  and he saved her life without thinking. She starts to think that everything she was told about monsters was wrong. He asks her what she\'s doing  and she lies and says that the device is an old family heirloom  and she wants to get it back. Taking another step  she sets off a second booby trap  and Dracula grabs another ax out of the air. Testing him  she skips forward  setting off all the traps  with him saving her every time. He ends up with axes  darts and arrows embedded all over his body. She grabs the device  causing the room to shake and crumble  and he flies her out just before she gets crushed.Mavis catches up to them  and sees Dracula looking like a pincushion from the traps. Her eyes turn angry  and she levitates Ericka up. Dracula tells her to stop  then says that when he first saw her  he zinged. Stunned  Mavis drops Ericka  and she asks what a zing is. Dracula explains that it\'s a love at first sight for monsters. Feeling guilty  Ericka tells him that she can never be with a monster  and she runs off. Mavis hugs Dracula  and he sulks away.Back on the ship  Murray shows off the tattoo he got last night  and Griffin and Crystal walk up  with her wearing a wedding ring on her invisible finger. Frank and Eunice arrive  and he has no arms  having lost them gambling. In her room  Ericka shows the device to Abraham  and then tells him that Dracula saved her life. She says the way he acted with Mavis was almost human  and he replies that monsters have no feelings  and they must fulfill the mission. The next day  Frank has replaced his arms with lobster claws from the seafood buffet. At a dance party  Mavis is still trying to process the fact that Dracula zinged with Ericka  and Johnny tells her that love makes them do crazy things. He reminds her that they were different species  but when they zinged  nothing could keep them apart. Realizing that Johnny was right  she runs up to talk to Dracula. She tells him that he has to tell Ericka how he feels  and he starts off to find her. Just then  the music stops  and Abraham\'s face comes on the monitors. He says he knows that Dracula recognizes him  and he holds up the device. Dracula says that it\'s just Ericka\'s heirloom  but Abraham reveals that Ericka retrieved it because she\'s his great-granddaughter. He shows them that it\'s a canister with sheet music. He plays the music on a piano  stirring a creature known as the Kraken.With the Kraken swatting at the guests  Dracula flies toward Abraham  but is caught by the Kraken in midair. He tries to free himself by changing forms  but the Kraken maintains its grip. Ericka looks at him sadly. Trapped and growing weaker  Dracula submits to defeat. Mavis tries to save him  but the Kraken pins her down  and throws Dracula into the air toward his mouth. At the last second  Ericka jumps and bounces off Blobby  and she grabs Dracula out of the air. They land in water at the edge of the dance floor  and she holds him up and tells Abraham that he can\'t kill Dracula. She says monsters have families  and laugh and love just like people. She says she knows it because when she first saw Dracula  she zinged.With renewed determination  Dracula starts to fight back against the Kraken. Johnny stops him and tells him that the only way to fight the ominous music that Abraham is playing is with happy music. He sets up his DJ equipment and plays  Good Vibrations.  The Kraken starts to sway to the beat  until Abraham makes his music louder  causing the Kraken to resume the attack. Finding an even brighter song  Johnny plays  Don\'t Worry  Be Happy   and the Kraken starts swaying again. Abraham makes his music louder still  and Johnny realizes he needs the ultimate musical weapon  and starts playing  The Macarena.  Soon  both the Kraken and Abraham are moving their arms to the music  unable to control themselves. Abraham falls off the DJ booth and toward the water  and Dracula turns into a bat and flies up to him  grabbing him before he hits. Dracula returns Abraham to the dance floor  and he asks why he had saved him. Dracula says that human or monster  we are all the same. Ericka runs up and hugs him  and Abraham sheepishly offers them all a full refund for the cruise. The wolf pups stampede around the deck  and everyone realizes they haven\'t seen Wayne and Wanda in a long time. Ericka takes them to the closet where she had hidden them  and Dracula zaps them back to life.Back at the hotel  Dracula and Ericka sneak up to the roof  and she asks if he\'s going to suck her blood. He responds by getting down on one knee and opening a box with a spider-shaped ring with a red jewel. The ring claws its way onto her finger  and she tries to answer  but can only speak gibberish. Everyone else shows up and asks what her answer was. Recovering  she says yes  and everyone cheers. Tinkles happily runs in and tackles them both. A happy new chapter had begun at the Hotel Transylvania.' , 'Family vacation. It will suck the life out of you.'   He's going to need a vacation after this vacation.   'Kick back with the pack.'

David discovers that Margot had been pocketing the money for the lessons  before suddenly transferring $2 500 to a deleted account on Venmo. Realizing that Margot is missing  David calls the police  and the case is assigned to Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing)  who asks for information about Margot\'s personality and friendships. David manages to access Margot\'s Facebook and speaks to her contacts but discovers that Margot has not had close friends since Pamela\'s death. Vick calls to report that Margot made a fake ID for herself and shows traffic-camera footage of Margot\'s car at a highway-juncture outside of the city  suggesting that Margot may have deliberately run away.David  unconvinced  discovers that Margot has been using a  vlogging  site called YouCast and that she frequently spoke to a working-class girl named fish-and-chips. Vick investigates this  and reports back that fish-and-chips is innocent  having been sighted in Pittsburgh. From Margot\'s Instagram  David finds that Margot frequently visited Barbosa Lake  which is near the highway-juncture. He drives to the lake and finds Margot\'s Pokemon key-chain on the ground. The police arrive and discover Margot\'s car underwater and an envelope containing $2 500.A sweep of the surrounding area is conducted by the police and volunteers  but a thunderstorm slows the progress.

He has been sent by other Christian communities outside of Rome to meet with Paul the Apostle and persuade him to help in writing an account of his wisdom. Luke meets with Priscilla and Aquila  the leaders of the Christian community hiding out in the city  who are currently debating whether to stay in Rome and continue to provide hope to persecuted victims of Nero\'s pogrom or to leave Rome with their community to avoid certain death.Paul has been imprisoned inside Mamertine Prison for his strong influence as a Christian leader which makes him a threat to Nero\'s power and the Roman Empire. Mauritius Gallus  the newly appointed prefect of the prison  accuses him of burning half of Rome down and  under Nero\'s decree  sentences him to death. Luke uses forged papers to sneak into the prison and joyfully greets a weary  physically beaten Paul. Paul and Luke both agree that Paul\'s time is soon coming to an end and so Luke convinces Paul to help him write an account of how Paul  formerly known as Saul of Tarsus  came to be one of Christianity\'s greatest leaders. Mauritius discovers that Luke manged to sneak into the prison with the help of high-ranking Romans  but allows him to visit Paul unscathed because those Romans are also friends of Mauritius.Paul begins narrating his origins: That he was once Saul of Tarsus  a Jewish boy  who was influenced by the zealotry of the Jewish leaders and witnessed the martyrdom of Stephen at their hands for professing his faith in Jesus Christ. This event made Saul vow to destroy all Christians throughout the world. Mauritius laments the fact that he has been made prefect of the prison despite his many deeds for Rome and that his daughter is dying from a terrible sickness despite all his sacrifices to the Roman gods. At a tavern  his friends suggest that he find some evidence that the Christians were responsible for burning down Rome despite rumors abounding that it was Nero who started the fire.The Christian community continues to suffer losses  including a Roman boy named Tarquin who was sent to enlist the aid of Roman citizens sympathetic to the Christians\' plight. Tarquin\'s cousin  Cassius  adamantly calls for Christians to take up arms and seek revenge against the Romans for all their persecutions. But  Aquila rebukes him by saying that Paul never sought revenge or wished ill upon all those who harmed him and that  love is the only way . Luke  having witnessed the Roman\'s barbarism and cruelty  relates this news to Paul and begins to sympathize with the need for revenge. Paul  however  admonishes him for  giving up on the world when Christ did not  and tells him that the very love which Christ died for is the only way to counter this evil. Inspired by these words  Luke lets go of his anger and continues writing down Paul\'s story.At this point  Paul relates his story about how he hunted down and butchered many Christians throughout the Holy Land until the day he rode for Damascus with his brethren. He became blinded by God and heard His voice asking why Saul persecuted Him. This event along with Saul\'s meeting Ananias  a disciple of Christ  humbles Saul so deeply that he repents of his actions. Ananias restores Saul\'s sight and baptizes him in the name of the Lord  which leads to Saul rejecting his former name and becoming Paul.Mauritius  having heard about Paul\'s reputation as a preacher and miracle worker  speaks with Paul and relays his concerns that his daughter is dying. Paul suggests that Luke be allowed to examine her and help  but Mauritius refuses to allow a Christian into his home despite the protests of his wife who is growing impatient with Mauritius\' hubris. Further  Mauritius has Luke imprisoned under the assumption that Paul and Luke are plotting an escape from the prison to lead an uprising against Rome. Paul  however  assures him that this is not the case and offers Luke words of comfort that he will find the strength to love and forgive their enemies.Cassius  having lost all patience with Priscilla and Aquila\'s pacifism  decides to take matters into his own by bringing an armed group of men to storm the prison and free Paul. But  Paul rejects their offer of rescue by telling them that Christ has already won the victory upon the cross. Dejected  Cassius and the others escape before more guards arrive and disappear into the night. Mauritius angrily accuses Paul and Luke of the conspiracy to escape despite their protests and has Luke thrown into prison along with other imprisoned Christians. After learning that they will be sentenced to Nero\'s circus to be devoured by wild beasts  Luke leads the other Christians in prayer asking the Lord to forgive their captors for their impending execution.Mauritius finally relents after fearing the loss of her daughter and has Luke brought to his house to help save her. Luke sends Mauritius to Aquila and Priscilla for supplies needed to heal the child. Mauritius  amazed that Luke would entrust the lives of other Christians to him  goes alone to their hiding place and begs for their help. Although initially wary and distrustful of a Roman asking for their assistance  they relent and give Mauritius the supplies he requests. With the items delivered  Luke is able to use his healing skills as a physician to cure the warden\'s daughter of her illness at the same time that the imprisoned Christians are thrown into the circus.With his daughter finally healthy again  Mauritius graciously spares Luke\'s life and thanks Paul for continuing to show him compassion and kindness. Although Mauritius is sorry for the deaths of the Christians in the arena  Paul responds by saying that Mauritius may yet come to know Jesus Christ and God\'s undying love.

Rick Wershe Jr. (Richie Merritt) is a teenager examining some AK-47 automatic rifles for sale and negotiating a price with the dealer. He notices that the gun has details consistent with Egyptian-made AK-47s  unlike the Russian-made ones the dealer claims he\'s selling. He calls his father  Richard \'Rick\' Wershe Sr. (Matthew McConaughey)  over to confirm his suspicions and they blackmail the dealer into giving them a heavy discount in exchange for not ratting him out and costing him his license.The father and son then head home to Detroit  Michigan. Richard is talking about how they\'re both lions in a world of sheep. Richard is a small-time arms dealer who dreams of opening a video rental store one day. Rick is his 15-year-old son who seems to just go with the flow. When they return home  they see another car parked in their driveway. Both Richard and Rick recognize it as Ty\'s car. They get out of the car  and Richard pulls out one of the AK-47s and bursts in the house to his daughter  Dawn (Rick\'s older sister)  making out with her boyfriend  Ty. Richard immediately guesses she\'s high and kicks Ty out of the house  with Dawn (Bel Powley) running out of the house to chase after him in her underwear. Their grandparents (who live right across the street) pull up just in time to see the whole event. Richard calms the situation down  and they go out for custard.Later that night  Richard is finishing up crafting silencers for the AK-47s and explaining to Rick about the concept of  up-selling.  Rick uses this new knowledge to sell the AK-47s to some local gang members that he\'s familiar with. He makes a huge profit by up-selling them on the silencers and earns some respect from the gang\'s leader  Johnny Curry. Rick starts hanging with them and partying at a local roller skating rink that is frequented by the gang and corrupt cops.Early the next morning  Rick is woken up by Dawn  who tells him that she\'s leaving. Rick correctly guesses that she\'s going to live with Ty and tries to convince her to stay and leave Ty. Dawn leaves anyway and gives her a number to contact her  telling him not to give it to their Dad. However  Richard witnesses her leaving and stares out the window as she and Ty drive away. Later on  Richard is being hassled by the FBI  as his weapons are ending up in the hands of the gang members around town. FBI agents Alexandra ( Alex ) and Frank tell him they know about his illegally-made silencers and will catch him sooner or later. They ask Rick if he knows anything about the gang members  but Rick keeps quiet and only informs them that the gang members they pictured are dead.That afternoon  Rick is hanging out with the gang while they pick out tuxes for Curry\'s upcoming wedding to the mayor\'s niece  Cathy. Curry talks to Rick about respect and shows that he\'s earned his by telling Rick to try on a tux  subtly inviting him to his wedding. Rick attends the wedding and meets Art Derrick  a drug kingpin from Miami. On their way home from the wedding  Rick is riding with his friends from the gang  Nugg  Boo  Freaky Steve  and Ed when they happen on a few girls from their school. Rick calls out to one of them  Brenda Moore  who happens to be his crush from school  and asks them if they want to join them. The girls go with them to a drive-in movie theater  and Rick gets intimate with Brenda.A few days later  Rick is returning home from a night out and sees a stuffed duck on the side of the road. He takes it with him as a gift for his sister but is then approached by a vehicle  whose passengers reveal themselves to be the FBI agents from before along with a narcotics police officer. They tell him that the silenced AK-47s he sold to the gang were used to commit a murder and they can use that to arrest his father unless Rick cooperates by making drug purchases so they can gather evidence against the gang. Rick  being backed into a corner  agrees to cooperate. He picks up some crack cocaine from a local dealer and delivers it back to the agents. After several times  the agents then hand him a brick of cocaine and tell him to sell it in order to better blend in with the gang crowd (people in Detroit who only buy and don\'t appear to be undercover cops). They tell him he can keep whatever money he makes  and Rick sells the cocaine and pockets $4 000.Later on  Curry confronts Rick with the knowledge that he\'s been selling cocaine to his customers. He warns Rick to be more transparent with him and allows him to sell with his other dealers  provided he gets his customary cut. After a few months  Rick is living the good life with the gang  even traveling to Vegas for a boxing title fight. Curry had been promised by one his customers  Leon  that he had set him and his crew up in Vegas with ringside seats and would have his money by the time they got back. When they showed up to the fight  they were denied  as Leon had given the tickets to another gang leader. After the fight  everyone went to an after-party  and the other gang leader flaunted in front of Curry  who responded by beating him to death with a champagne bottle.When Rick and the gang returned from Vegas  Curry sent two of his men to kill Leon at his house. However  Leon left shortly before they arrived and when the two gang members opened fire on the house from outside  a bullet hit one of Leon\'s young sons  killing him. This made big news  and now police were rounding up anyone who possessed AK-47s. The gang and even Richard were all getting rid of the ones they had. Curry gathered his gang together  including Rick  and let them know that they had to be extremely careful now and that he would do whatever it took to stay out of prison. When Rick returned home  Richard was just leaving and told him that he had been given a goldfish as a gift from one of his customers. An hour later  Rick was looking at the fish when his friend and fellow gang members  Nugg  came to the house. Rick got him a soda  but when he turned around Nugg shot him in the stomach and fled. Rick was saved through a long surgery and was able to recover fully  albeit slowly. In the hospital  Rick was listed under a fake name for his protection  and the FBI agents let him know that because of his help  they were able to take down Curry and most of his crew.Later  Rick and Richard were driving home and began talking again about opening a video store. Rick expressed his doubts that they would ever do anything with their lives and Richard almost crashed the car while arguing back. Luckily  they were both uninjured  and Rick pleaded with his Dad to let him become a cocaine dealer again so that they could finally have a good life. Richard was initially against it  but eventually relented and Rick began to sell cocaine on the streets  making a steady stream of big money.A short time later  Rick and Richard approached a house filled with drug users and found Dawn asleep in one of the rooms. Rick told her they were taking her home and she kicked and screamed the whole way. They locked her in her room back home while she detoxed from the drugs she was on. While difficult in the beginning  she eventually made a full recovery after several days. After months of selling cocaine  Rick had earned more than enough money to make his Dad\'s dream come true  and Richard was able to open up a video store.The next morning  Rick answers a knock at the door to find a little kid who tells him that his sister  Brenda  just had a baby and that it\'s Rick\'s. Rick and Richard travel to Brenda\'s house to meet Rick\'s daughter  Keisha  and they take turns holding her. A few days later  Rick talks with Curry\'s wife  Cathy  at the roller rink and they eventually go back to her place. Cathy tells Rick that if Curry had been smart and only trusted the people she put him in contact with  he wouldn\'t have gone to prison and left her alone. She and Rick then have sex.During the next year  FBI agents storm Rick\'s house and arrest Rick and Richard. Rick is held on drug possession with intent distribute  and since he had more than eight grams  it would be for a life-sentence in prison. They later speak with Alex and Frank  who tell them that the FBI will publicly deny any relationship with Rick  but will try to get his sentence reduced if he cooperates on one of last informant task. Rick has Cathy help him out with a large shipment of cocaine and the FBI raid the deal and arrest everyone involved. Unfortunately  they announce Rick\'s name on television as having been the instigator of the bust  putting him in danger. At his court hearing  the jury concludes that Rick is guilty and the judge gives him the full life-sentence in prison. Richard confronts Alex and Frank  and they tell him that they never made any promises for Rick and that it\'s over.A year goes by  and Dawn and Richard visit Rick in prison along with Rick\'s daughter Keisha. Rick tells Dawn to keep showing Keisha his picture every night. Richard then talks to him about his case and lets him know the mandatory life-sentence for drug offenses might be overturned soon. Rick laments that his life over now that he\'s in prison and Richard tears up and apologizes for not being able to give him an easy life like he wanted to. Rick is then led back to his cell and Richard  Dawn  and Keisha leave to go home.The credits reveal that Rick stayed in prison for over 30 years  holding the record for the longest prison term for a non-violent offender in the state of Michigan. He was finally released on parole in 2017. His father  Richard  passed away in 2014. His daughter  Keisha  is now happily married with two sons. A voice recording of the real Rick Wershe Jr. plays in the background  with him stating that nobody thought he should really be in prison  but that he was feeling happy and hopeful.' ,  Witness the rise of America's youngest hustler  dealer  kingpin  informant  legend.

Medics arrive on the scene and recover one survivor  astronaut J.J. Jameson III (Chris O\'Hara). Jameson is brought into an ambulance where something that has latched onto him has come alive and attacks those inside the vehicle  causing it to flip and crash. An EMT (Michelle Lee) steps out of the wreckage  now playing host to the alien entity known as the symbiote.In San Francisco  we are introduced to reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy)  who lives with his fiance  a lawyer named Anne Weying (Michelle Williams)  who is set to represent the Life Foundation and its CEO  Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Eddie is well-known for his TV news show   The Eddie Brock Report   where he undergoes investigative stories to share with others. When he gets to work  Eddie\'s boss (Ron Cephas Jones) sends him to interview Drake  but he asks Eddie to not press Drake with any questions about his work. Anne asks the same since she knows Eddie can be hotheaded  which is what got him driven out of New York.Eddie finds an email on Anne\'s computer with information regarding three confirmed deaths resulting from the shuttle crash. Against his orders  Eddie goes to interview Drake about his space travel program  but then goes off-script and starts to ask Drake about the deaths and how he is responsible for them. Drake cuts the interview short  and Eddie\'s boss fires him. Anne also gets fired  and she breaks up with Eddie.Back in Malaysia  the EMT wanders into a local market and starts to eat an eel. The vendor chastises her for it  so the symbiote forms a blade around her arm  and she slits the vendor\'s throat. Nearby onlookers try to attack her in retribution  but the symbiote releases quills that kills everyone around her. The EMT then walks to an elderly woman (Vickie Eng)  and the symbiote releases the EMT (who is now dead) and latches onto the old woman.Six months later.Drake is continuing his research into symbiotes by having tests run on homeless people. He speaks to one subject named Isaac (Jared Bankens) to make it seem like he is taking on some kind of groundbreaking task for mankind. Drake releases a symbiote into the room with Isaac and lets the entity overtake his body. He seems fine for a while until he begins convulsing  and the symbiote leaves Isaac\'s now dead body  having devoured his organs.In San Francisco  Eddie is now jobless and alone  living in a small seedy apartment. He goes to a nearby shop where he is acquainted with the clerk  Mrs. Chen (Peggy Lu)  but Eddie sees that she is constantly getting robbed of her money by a thug (Sam Medina)  and he is unable to do anything about it. Eddie is then approached by Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate)  a scientist from the Life Foundation who is appalled by Drake\'s experiments on humans. She wants Eddie\'s help in exposing Drake  but he refuses to go along because he doesn\'t care about what happens to mankind anymore.Eddie goes to Anne\'s apartment to visit her  only to find her coming back from a date with her new boyfriend  Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott). Once they are alone  Eddie admits to Anne that he misses her and that he blames Drake for what happened to him  but Anne tells him that it\'s his own fault that he has hit rock bottom. Eddie later calls Skirth to join in on her mission.Skirth brings Eddie to the Life Foundation\'s headquarters and sneaks him in. Eddie takes pictures of the gruesome displays of the symbiote\'s victims. He recognizes one of the living ones as Maria (Melora Walters)  a homeless woman that Eddie is friendly with. He tries to break her out of her cell  only for Maria to attack him. The symbiote in her body then latches itself onto Eddie  and he runs out. Security guards chase Eddie  and he now appears to have enhanced strength and agility  allowing him to escape.Drake and his people find Maria\'s body and know that there is a symbiote specimen on the loose. Drake gets Skirth to admit that Eddie was involved  and he leaves her inside a cell to be killed by another symbiote. Drake then sends a team of mercenaries led by Roland Treece (Scott Haze) to go after Eddie.Eddie starts to experience bizarre symptoms. He has an appetite for weird food choices (among them are frozen tater tots and rotten meat) and he feels like he has a fever. He also starts to hear a low  growling voice speaking to him. He finds Anne and Dan on a date where he shows off how messed up he is while also going through other peoples\' food  and then sitting in a lobster tank to eat live lobsters. Anne and Dan figure they have to help Eddie.Dan does an MRI test on Eddie  but the frequency from the test causes a painful distortion in Eddie\'s head.Back home  Eddie is once again in pain when his neighbor plays his music too loud. Eddie goes to tell him to turn it down and is scoffed at until the symbiote mutates Eddie\'s face into a monstrous form  and the neighbor promptly agrees. Moments later  Treece and his goons break into Eddie\'s home to capture him. Eddie tries to surrender  but the symbiote has other plans. As the mercs attack  Eddie finds himself fighting them off involuntarily with the help of the symbiote. Treece records this to show off to Drake  who is amazed that Eddie is a fitting match for the symbiote. Eddie then flees his apartment as more mercs start to show up. Eddie is chased through the city as he finds a motorcycle to ride. The symbiote helps him take out the goons and also maneuver through the streets with ease  until Treece slams into Eddie with his car. As he approaches Eddie  the symbiote overtakes Eddie\'s whole body  transforming him into VENOM. Before Venom can kill Treece  another merc shoots at him. Venom bites his head off and then retreats.Eddie finds himself near a lighthouse where his bones are miraculously healed. Venom (what the symbiote calls itself... himself?) speaks to Eddie and says he is a great host  though Eddie is mortified at seeing a man\'s head get bitten off. Venom tells Eddie that if he wants to survive  he need only comply.As Venom  Eddie climbs to the top of his former workplace to deliver evidence of Drake\'s crimes to his old boss. He nearly falls off the roof when a plane passes overhead and its frequency disrupts the symbiote  but Venom manages to catch Eddie before he hits the ground. After leaving the evidence  Eddie tries to leave  only for the mercs to try and get him once more. Venom fights them off before retreating.Eddie and Anne find each other after she goes by his apartment and sees that it\'s a crime scene  and she brings him to Dan\'s office for more help. She knows something is wrong with Eddie. Venom tells Eddie to talk to Anne  as Venom has taken a liking to her. Eddie apologizes for his screw-ups  though Anne tells him it\'s not the time.Dan runs another test on Eddie and determines that the symbiote is a parasite (which Venom does NOT like to be called). After Dan tells Eddie that he and the symbiote are essentially draining each other of life  Anne turns on a high frequency that causes the symbiote to pull off of Eddie\'s body. Venom escapes through the vents after Eddie leaves  and he latches himself onto a small dog. Treece and his men then finally get Eddie and bring him to Drake.Meanwhile  the elderly woman from earlier goes to an airport and finds a small girl to use as a new symbiote host. The girl makes her way to San Francisco and finds Drake  and the symbiote then takes over Drake\'s body.Drake interrogates Eddie over the whereabouts of the symbiote. The symbiote in Drake forms around his body  naming itself Riot. Eddie learns that Drake\'s plan is to head back into space and find more symbiotes to bring back to Earth for them to use humans as hosts.Anne finds the dog that is hosting Venom  and she then heads to the Life Foundation as she now hosts Venom (making her She-Venom). Anne helps break Eddie free and also bites off Treece\'s head (which horrifies her)  and she transfers Venom back to Eddie through a kiss.Eddie and Venom head off the find Drake and Riot before they board the rocket. The two men fight using their symbiote forms  while Anne turns on a frequency to disrupt both of them and make the symbiotes leave their hosts. Drake sees Riot and tries to reattach himself  but Eddie kicks him off the ledge. Eddie turns around and is impaled by Riot  who then boards the rocket as it starts to lift off. Venom finds Eddie and latches back onto him  healing the impalement wound. They then leap onto the rocket as Venom cuts open the fuel line  causing the rocket to explode and incinerate Drake and Riot. The flames from the rocket also cause Venom to seemingly  die  as Eddie falls into the water.Sometime later  Eddie and Anne appear to have mended their relationship as friends. He mentions being asked to bring his show back and do a show on Drake  but he has other plans to meet with someone in prison. It also turns out that Venom is still inside Eddie  though he keeps that a secret from Anne. Eddie walks away and bumps into an old man (Stan Lee)  who encourages him to not stop fighting for what he loves. Venom also wants to eat the man\'s dog.Eddie walks around with Venom and tries to explain to him that if they are going to stick together  that he cannot just eat any person he wants  and that they may only target the really bad people. He goes into Mrs. Chen\'s shop  and the thug from earlier attempts to accost her for money again. Eddie morphs into Venom and devours the thug in front of Mrs. Chen. Eddie asks Venom what they should do next  and he responds that they can do whatever they want.Mid-Credits: Eddie goes to San Quentin Prison for an interview with his newest subject  a serial killer by the name of Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson).

He comments how Camilla is growing  and he has her sit beside him. Sensing his lurid intentions  Lisbeth grabs Camilla and runs back to their room. Lisbeth runs outside their balcony and gets ready to jump. She waits for Camilla to join her  but Camilla rejoins Alexander when he orders them to go back to him. Lisbeth jumps and slides down the hill below the house  and she escapes  never to return home.Over 20 years later  we find a CEO in Sweden who has beaten his wife. The lights go out in his house  and he goes to turn them back on  only to see Lisbeth (now played by Claire Foy) standing there as a dark hooded figure with eerie makeup to obscure her face. She knocks over a statue tied with a rope that wraps around the CEO\'s feet and hangs him upside down. Lisbeth tells him that she knows of his deeds  like beating up two prostitutes and sleeping with the wife of a man who bankrolled his company. Lisbeth says she has removed all of his funds and put them in the accounts of the prostitutes and the man\'s wife  if the wife will simply give her the codes. The wife hesitates for a moment  then gives Lisbeth the account codes and takes her daughter away. The CEO says that whatever Lisbeth does now  he\'ll just have it reversed.

After Sofia leaves  Lisbeth receives a message regarding something highly valuable.Lisbeth meets with Frans Balder (Stephen Merchant)  a former contractor for the National Security Agency. He informs Lisbeth of a program he developed called Firefall  which has the power to access the world\'s nuclear launch codes  and he feels that  in the wrong hands  it can lead to dangerous and devastating results. He regretted doing it and now Balder hires Lisbeth to steal Firefall back from NSA.At the NSA headquarters in Washington  security expert Edwin Needham (Lakeith Stanfield) sees an alert for an unauthorized user in their system. He attempts to shut their systems down  but it\'s too late  and Lisbeth has taken Firefall and left a taunting image to Needham.Lisbeth attempts to access Firefall  but finds herself unable to do so because it requires answers to a series of cryptic prompts to activate it. Soon  a trio of masked thugs break into Lisbeth\'s apartment and try shooting at her  one bullet hitting her in the back of the left shoulder  in her dragon tattoo. The leader of the thugs turns on the gas and leaves some particles on an alarm clock to create sparks  causing an explosion in the apartment that Lisbeth narrowly escapes by jumping into the tub.

Mikael finds a spider tattoo on him and traces it back to a man named Milos Meer (Hendrik Heutmann). Milos explains that what he has is not a tattoo  but a scar given to him by the group that he is looking for  the Spiders. He says he had encountered the Spiders before. He pulls off a full-face mask to reveal that his nose and upper lip had been crudely cut off leaving him horribly disfigured. Milos warns Mikael not to go asking about the Spiders.Needham finds a name tag bracelet of Sofia in Lisbeth\'s burned apartment and goes to a club where he finds Sofia  knowing of her connection to Lisbeth. After convincing her that Lisbeth can\'t be trusted  she gives Needham her phone so that he can contact Lisbeth. As he does so  Lisbeth is monitoring the Spiders\' movements to try and catch them. Lisbeth tricks Needham into thinking she was fooled by him and sabotages his attempt to find her. She then spots Jan Holtser (Claes Bang) and his goons kill the policemen guarding Balder through a security camera. Having watched the scene on a camera she placed  Lisbeth goes to find Balder and his son August (Christopher Convery)  but Holtser reaches them at the same time. After a struggle  Holtser overpowers Lisbeth  injects her with a drug  and while she is conscious but unable to move he uses her hand to shoot and kill Balder. They then take August with them  leaving her on the floor to die. Through an enormous effort  Lisbeth reaches a bottle of pills  dumps some on the floor  crushes them into powder with the bottle  and inhales the powder. She begins to recover enough to get out of the building. She gets into the police car that had been guarding the building  pulling out the dead driver. Lisbeth pursues them and hacks into their car\'s remote access feature to cause their airbags to deploy  which knocks the villains unconscious and makes their car slow down so Lisbeth can safely get August out. They turn to drive away when a truck comes over the bridge to pursue them. Lisbeth climbs up a bridge tower  smashes safety glass  and activates the bridge-raising mechanism  leaving the truck high above her car  unable to follow. Then Lisbeth sees Camilla dressed in red  standing in the road watching her leave. Then she realizes that Camilla is behind the plot to take August.Lisbeth brings August to stay with her at a safe location. He has a strange lack of emotion over his father\'s death  and says he would like to go back to his mother. After he beats her at a chess game in only a few moves  she realizes he is a genius. She asks for his help in unlocking Firefall  and after earning his trust  he explains to her that the phrases she needs to decode are complex number problems based on the letters used  which is something that Balder knew his son could figure out.Needham is eventually found by Grane when he is snooping around the building where Balder was killed. Grane has him arrested and locked up. Lisbeth manages to remotely unlock his holding cell and lead him to a hidden cell phone where he is able to communicate with her. With Plague\'s help  Lisbeth convinces Needham to take August with him to America to rejoin his mother. Needham agrees  but he says he won\'t go back home without Firefall. He leaves with Plague.Soon  Lisbeth is led to the true mastermind behind the Spiders -- Camilla (now played by Sylvia Hoeks). She took over the Spiders from her father after his death. It is also revealed that Grane was the client in the scheme to steal Firefall. Grane wanted Sweden to get control of Firefall so it could never be used; she did not trust the U.S. to have the wisdom to have custody of it. Camilla says that the Spiders changed their mind  and they are going to keep it. She kills Grane by slitting her jugular vein with a razor-sharp blade hidden in the ring. She and her henchmen kidnap August and take him to their hideout  which is her and Lisbeth\'s childhood home.Camilla orders August to unlock Firefall  and she gets Holtser to show Lisbeth a video where they have Mikael hostage. Holtser threatens to inject Mikael with two needles filled with serums; one will blind him  and the other will kill him. Lisbeth convinces August to solve the codes to unlock Firefall  but before Camilla and her men can access it  suddenly we hear a  ping  and one man falls. Plague is in a van with an infrared scanner  giving Needham targeting information so he can act as a sniper with a very high-powered weapon integrated to the equipment in the van helping him target the men inside the building. He takes down the gang one by one  shooting right through walls. Lisbeth makes it in and takes out some henchmen herself  even injecting Holtser with the first serum. Camilla tries to escape with another henchman  and Holtser emerges from the woods in front of the car  now barely able to see as a result of the serum. Camilla congratulates the driver on the successful escape inadvertently distracting him from the road at the exact moment the blind Holtser stumbles in the path of the car. The car hits him and runs off the road and crashes. Lisbeth pursues Camilla until they reach the side of a cliff  and Lisbeth aims her gun at Camilla. She knows of Lisbeth\'s reputation for helping victimized women  but she asks Lisbeth why she didn\'t go back to help her. Camilla said she suffered at the hands of their father for 16 years  always wondering why Lisbeth abandoned her. Lisbeth tearfully states that it\'s because Camilla chose their father. Camilla realizes she has become the monster that their father was  and she lets herself fall off the edge of the cliff to her death  echoing the initial scene where Lisbeth falls off the balcony to escape. Camilla leaves only the laptop with Firefall on the ground where she last stood. A bit later Needham tries to access Firefall  only to find it has been deleted  with a message saying  This is what Balder would have wanted. Mikael is in his office writing a new article in which he details Lisbeth and Camilla\'s whole ordeal  but he decides to erase the whole thing instead of having it published.In the final scene  Lisbeth goes to her home one last time as she rigs the place to blow up.

Oliver Hardy (John C. Reilly)  however  remains tied to Roach on a different contract and isn\'t let go  with the studio attempting to pair him up with Harry Langdon in the film Zenobia  and while Laurel and Hardy would soon get back together  Ollie\'s absence during a meeting with Fox results in them not being signed on by the studio  leaving Stan feeling betrayed and bitter for years.In 1953  the comedy duo embarks on a grueling music hall tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland while struggling to get another film made: a comedic adaptation of Robin Hood. However  poor publicity before the show in Britain managed by the producer Bernard Delfont (Rufus Jones) means the tour begins in almost empty back street theaters with Delfont seeming more interested in his up-and-coming star Norman Wisdom. Belatedly  Delfont organizes some public appearances  and word of their visit to Britain spreads  resulting in them filling much larger prestigious venues.During the tour the pair  driven by Stan  continues to write and develop gags for the film. There is  however  an ominous silence from its London-based producer. Once the tour arrives in London  Stan pays a visit to the film\'s producer himself and discovers there is insufficient funding  and the project has been canceled. He can\'t bring himself to tell Ollie  and their script development continues.They are soon joined by their respective wives  Ida Laurel (Nina Arianda) and Lucille Hardy (Shirley Henderson)  at London\'s Savoy Hotel before they are to perform at a sold-out two-week residency at the nearby Lyceum Theatre. After the opening night at the Lyceum  a party is held to honor them. At the party tensions begin to show between the two wives leading Delfont to remark that he\'s got two double acts for the price of one. As the night progresses  however  Stan\'s feelings of Ollie\'s betrayal come to the surface after his wife brings up the  elephant movie  (The movie Ollie did without Stan when he left the studio  with Ollie still under contract for one movie)  resulting in the two having a public argument over the movie contract fiasco that split them up.As Stan unloads his pent-up resentment for what he considers to be a betrayal of their friendship and accuses Ollie of being lazy  Ollie unloads his own pent-up feelings towards Stan  claiming that the two weren\'t really friends  only being together because Hal Roach studios had paired them up and that Stan never loved him as a friend but only loved Laurel and Hardy. As a result of the argument Ollie leaves the party with his wife  who had also had an argument with Stan\'s wife  and leaving Stan alone.Despite their friendship having taken a blow  they press on with their public appearances  which include judging a beauty contest in the seaside resort of Worthing  Ollie refusing to speak to Stan despite the latter\'s attempts. However  just when they are about to announce the winner  Ollie collapses from a heart attack and is forced into bed rest. Informed two days later that it\'s unlikely Ollie will get better in time to continue the tour  Delfont suggests having another well-known English comic take Ollie\'s place. When Stan visits Ollie in his room  Ollie tells Stan that he intends to retire immediately  explaining that a doctor warned him that he must never go onstage again because the strain could be fatal  and he and his wife will leave for America as soon as possible. Getting into bed with him to warm Ollie up  Stan asks whether Ollie meant what he said at the party. Ollie admits he didn\'t  and when asked the same by Ollie  Stan admits he didn\'t mean what he had said as well. The two share a silent moment together.On the night of the next show  Stan finds it impossible to work with the English comic Delfont has hired as a substitute so that the tour can continue  simply because he isn\'t Ollie  and the performance is canceled  much to Delfont\'s dismay. When his wife finds him at the bar  Stan confesses to her that he truly does love Ollie as a friend and intends to return to America instead of continuing the tour  though he asks her to make sure Ollie doesn\'t know he\'s leaving. Ollie in turn decides he can\'t spend the rest of his life idle in bed and leaves his hotel room just before his wife comes back. As they pack Stan\'s wife hears a knock on the door; when he answers it Stan is surprised to see Ollie  who\'d had a feeling Stan was leaving. The two finally recognize the real fondness that exists between them and what pleasure they get from each other  and as they silently forgive each other Ollie smiles and tells Stan they have a show to do  making Stan smile right back at his friend  and despite struggling during the night Ollie successfully performs on stage with Stan to a thunderous applause from the audience.While sailing to Ireland to continue the tour Stan finally confesses  he has deceived Ollie about the prospects of the future film even while they continued to work on it  and Stan believes no one wants to see another Laurel and Hardy movie. Ollie confesses in turn that he had read that from Stan\'s demeanor and already knew  confusing Stan greatly. He asks why they had kept working on the script if Ollie had known the truth all along. Ollie confesses that\'s all they could do. Upon arriving in Ireland  the duo is welcomed by a large crowd of fans  both young and old  the church bells of the town ring out their theme song  and they continue to complete the tour to great acclaim from their fans despite Ollie\'s poor health.As the film ends  a written epilogue reveals that the tour was the last time they ever worked together. Ollie\'s health continued deteriorating after the tour  leading to his death in 1957  and Stan  devastated by his friend\'s death  refused to work without his partner and effectively retired  dying eight years later in 1965.

Phil Phillips (Bill Barretta) is a former cop who is now a private investigator. He goes to his office where his secretary Bubbles (Maya Rudolph) tells him he has a visitor. A female puppet named Sandra White (voice of Dorien Davies) has come to ask Phil for help regarding someone who may be threatening her and has sent her a note. He notices that one of the letters cut to make the message looks familiar  so he decides to get on the case.Phil goes to a puppet porn shop to find a weird sex scene being filmed involving an octopus milking a cow. He asks the shop owner about the magazine they sell there  which has a font style matching the letters on the note. As Phil goes in the back to check the records  he runs into a familiar puppet named Mr. Bumblypants (voice of Kevin Clash)  who is trying to hide his porn addiction. When Phil is gone  a tall hooded person walks into the shop with a shotgun. He aims at Bumblypants until the owner pulls out his own gun in defense  but the gunman shoots the owner before blowing the heads off the octopus and cow  and then proceeds to kill Bumblypants.The authorities arrive on the scene after Phil discovers the dead puppets. He is dismayed to find his former partner  Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy)  is there  as the two had a falling out after Phil was kicked off the force. Edwards thinks it was a robbery gone wrong  but Phil notes that it was just murder because the assailant didn\'t take anything.Phil later has lunch with his brother Larry (Victor Yerrid)  a former actor who starred in the children\'s program  The Happytime Gang   along with Mr. Bumblypants. Since the show ended  Larry has tried to look less like a puppet by getting a nose job and bleaching his skin. A fan approaches Larry and asks him to say his famous catchphrase ( You\'re under arrest for being too hot to handle! )  which bugs Phil.Later that night  Larry is in a hot tub with a human woman while watching the show. She leaves to make drinks  and the killer from before sneaks behind the house and sets three dogs loose to grab Larry and tear him to pieces. Police arrive in the morning to the crime scene where Phil makes the horrifying discovery. After Edwards arrives  he tells Lt. Banning (Leslie David Baker) that he thinks Larry\'s death is connected with the porn shop murders because he feels Bumblypants was the intended victim  so the killer may be targeting members of  The Happytime Gang .Phil and Edwards reluctantly team up to investigate. They suspect that because the cast of  Happytime Gang  was expected to cement a new deal in which they would split a large amount of money between each other  someone may have wanted to kill them off to get the money to themselves. Phil and Edwards visit Ronovan Scargle (Michael McDonald)  one of the show\'s producers. Phil knocks him out and takes a file on his desk to look over.The detectives are led to a seedy part of the city where puppets are addicted to sugar and some of them are prostituting. They find Lyle (also Kevin Clash)  another former cast member who is now a drug lord. Since it\'s a strictly puppets only joint  Phil tells Lyle that Edwards can get in because she has a puppet liver. To test this  Lyle makes Edwards snort rock candy through a twizzler. Phil talks to Lyle outside while Edwards plays poker with the other puppet gangsters. One of them makes a sexist remark toward Edwards  as well as mistreating one of the female puppets in there  so Edwards kicks the stuffing out of the gangsters and makes them apologize. Outside  Lyle is shot to death by the killer  and Phil fails to catch him.Phil later returns to his office to find Sandra in there again. She tells Phil that the person harassing her has sent her another note  along with a picture of Sandra with Jenny (Elizabeth Banks)  the only human member of  The Happytime Gang  and former girlfriend of Phil. The killer threatens to expose something involving Jenny and Sandra.

They are part of a Black Ops group known as Overwatch  along with their partners Sam Snow (Ronda Rousey) and James Silva (Mark Wahlberg)  all monitored by Bishop  AKA  Mother  (John Malkovich). Alice and Douglas infiltrate the place  which is a safe house for Russian FSB agents  and the Overwatch team is trying to recover cesium they may be holding and prepping to use as weapons for terrorism. The two shoot and kill most of the agents in the house  but there is one hidden behind the walls  and he shoots Alice  wounding her. A young FSB agent  Anatole (David Garlik)  attempts to save the cesium and he falls out the window  but Silva corners him and shoots him. The Overwatch agents then destroy the house. News of the operation hits fast  especially that regarding Anatole\'s involvement.The opening credits give a brief history on Silva  who was said to be gifted at a young age and was later recruited into Black Ops forces not long after the death of his mother and brothers in a car accident. Throughout the film  we see bits of Silva giving a testimony on an operation.Indocarr City  16 months laterOverwatch is operating in Indonesia. Still hunting for the cesium houses  Alice says she has a source with information on them  while Silva acts hotheaded toward his teammates\' actions considering how urgent the matter is. Silva then takes on the task of speaking to a walk-in who needs help because the government wants to seize her assets  while Alice has to talk to her ex-husband Lucas (Peter Berg)  whom she hates because he isn\'t letting her see their daughter.A local police officer named Li Noor (Iko Uwais) arrives at the U.S. embassy to surrender himself  along with a disc that he claims contains the information Overwatch needs to find the other cesium houses. However  Li requests that he be escorted out of the country and given asylum in the United States in order to give them to the code to unlock the disc  or all the information on it will get wiped within a matter of hours.Elsewhere  a group of Russian agents led by Vera Kuragin (Natasha Goubskaya) are monitoring Li\'s whereabouts  as they are seemingly planning to have him killed within the next 24 hours.Li is brought into the medical room for tests. A man named Axel (Sam Medina) arrives with Indonesian intelligence agents to demand that Li be handed over to them  but Ambassador Dorothy Brady (Poorna Jagannathan) doesn\'t let them take him. Li is then attacked by two agents disguised as doctors after handcuffing him to the bed. Li fights them while handcuffed and kills them both. Sam and Alice witness this and are surprised at Li\'s fighting skills  and they learn he was once Indonesian Special Forces.Silva and his team  along with other separate operatives  proceed to escort Li to an airstrip that is 22 miles away  with Bishop keeping an eye on them. Li says he is going against the Indonesian government because they are responsible for the deaths of his family. En route  the team is followed by Axel\'s men on motorcycles  who plant grenades on Silva\'s van and blow it up. Some of the operatives are killed  and Sam is terribly wounded. Silva and his team open fire on Axel\'s guys  who return fire and continue to try and bomb them. Alice stays next to Li to protect him  although he helps get a few kills in as well. After doing away with most of them  Silva gives Sam two grenades  leaving her to blow herself and the rest of Axel\'s men up.Bishop guides Silva  Alice  Douglas  and Li to a restaurant where they have an inside guy working with them  so it is like a temporary reservation for them. Silva looks outside and sees Axel. He goes to approach him even though Bishop tells him to stay in the restaurant. Axel demands that Li be handed over  but Silva tells him to stop following them. When he goes back into the restaurant  two girls that he brushes past leave a grenade in another attack  but he manages to save a small girl standing near the grenade. Douglas is wounded  and the girls come back to attack and get Li  but Silva and Douglas kill both of them  just before more of Axel\'s guys come after them  prompting them to run.Bishop orders Silva to take Li to the airstrip immediately. Instead  they go to a safe house where Alice takes Li while Silva and Douglas fend off Axel and more of his goons. After a firefight  Silva goes back inside to find Alice and Li while Douglas keeps shooting back. He gets severely wounded until Axel walks up to him and finishes him with a bullet to the head. Bishop guides Silva to find Alice and Li. Alice has a brush with another henchman and almost dies until Li shoots the goon in the head.Silva  Alice  and Li finally make it to the airstrip  but Axel has found them yet again. Silva then has Bishop send a drone to blow Axel up for good. They then proceed to the plane where Alice goes with Li  who gives up the code to the disc. Before they depart  Li tells Silva  Say hi to Mother for me.  Before Silva can get an answer  the plane takes off. Bishop then sees that Li\'s heart rate is accelerating. Then  the disc starts to upload what turns out to be a picture of Anatole. Meanwhile  Vera and her men prepare to watch something about to take place. It then becomes clear that Li was a triple agent working for the Russian government  and that Anatole was Vera\'s son. Her men find Overwatch and shoot the whole team  but Bishop barely manages to get out.

After falling off the yacht and almost drowning  Tami has no choice but to make repairs to the ship in order to get it moving. She makes a makeshift sail using a broken pole and a storm jib (a triangular sail). She also uses a pump to prevent the cabin from flooding and then makes her way towards Richard. After successfully saving Richard  Tami realizes that Richard has broken ribs and a shattered right shin. While searching for food supplies  Tami realizes that she has a severe head injury and stitches the wound with a sail needle and thread.Back in 1983 (shortly before embarking on the ill-fated trip)  Tami and Richard bump into Peter and Christine Crompton (Jeffery Thomas and Elizabeth Hawthorne)  owners of the Haza??a  a luxury Trintella 44-foot yacht.

Tami prepares Richard and herself for the storm by creating a makeshift shelter.Cutting back to shortly before the hurricane struck  Tami and Richard receive news of the impending Hurricane Raymond but decide to continue to San Diego  with a slight diversion northward to attempt to avoid the central area of the hurricane  which has the highest winds and the roughest seas. Tami tries to radio for help but to no avail. The storm alters course unexpectectedly and the yacht then enters the eye of the storm. The ship struggles to stay afloat  the mainsail tears and the after boom breaks. Richard and Tami have no choice but to lower the sails to prevent the yacht from tipping over due to strong winds. While returning to the cockpit  Tami almost falls off the yacht after the ship hit turbulent waves. Richard professes his love for Tami and demands that she go below where she would be safer. Haza??a is flipped multiple times after encountering a rogue wave. Tami is thrown about in the cabin  thus suffering her severe head injury  and Richard is thrown overboard after he is knocked unconscious by the mast and his safety harness breaks. Richard slowly sinks into the depths of the ocean  while the Haza??a continues to flip multiple times and floats back to the surface thereafter.Back in real-time  Tami realizes that her perception of the injured Richard is nothing but a hallucination and surrenders to the reality that Richard has been lost at sea. Tami then sees islands in a distance and uses her binoculars to see better. She sees a Japanese research vessel in a distance and fires two flares in its direction. The research vessel then alters its course and heads towards Tami  rescuing her. Tami returns to Tahiti after recovering from her head injury and visits Richard's boat (the Mayaluga) and bursts into tears after seeing the wall of photos of Richard and her. Tami then goes to the beach with a frangipani flower and places her engagement ring from Richard around the flower and lets it go in the water.It is then revealed in the credits that Richard Sharp was swept overboard and was never found  Tami Oldham was all alone aboard the Haza??a for 41 days and that she continues to sail to date.  , 'Fight for survival.'

The film starts off by immediately establishing this in a series of short moments of her day to day life. She visits a clothing store where she is told by a clerk that her plus size may be better found on their online store. She visits a Soul Cycle class. In the locker room  she encounters a woman who far more matches Western beauty standards: thin  young  classic features. This woman is surprisingly friendly to Renee  asking if she too is there for the first time. This takes Renee aback as she is not used to beautiful women being kind to her. Renee then tries to participate in the class  but her bicycle seat collapses underneath her and slams into her groin  injuring her. (This is not because of her body weight but because the seat was not properly screwed in  but she takes it personally.)That night Renee gets together with her two best friends  Vivian (Aidy Bryant) and Jane (Busy Philipps.) In getting ready to meet them  Renee tries to follow along with styling instructional videos on YouTube but fails. She also reads gossip about the LeClaire family.After meeting up  the three sign up for a dating service where groups of three friends go out on triple-dates  and they discuss how no one on dating apps ever looks past the picture. They pose for group photos and decide on one to upload to the site. Then they go out for drinks and dancing. Renee\'s lack of self-confidence makes it difficult for her to get drinks at the bar. When Renee gets home that night  she undresses in front of the mirror and feels badly over her plump body and appearance.The next day we discover Renee works for LeClaire Cosmetics. However  she works in a dingy basement office in Chinatown and dreams of working at the main office downtown. Her schlubby co-worker Mason (Adrian Martinez) tries to make conversation with her but it\'s awkward  and ultimately he tells her that he masturbated the night before. Renee\'s job is to photograph cosmetics for display on the company website. Someone has complained that something she photographed is more orange in real life than in the photos  and she is frustrated with her job.We cut to the downtown offices where Avery LeClaire (Michelle Williams)  a beautiful and thin woman with a baby voice  is in a meeting with her staff. She is overseen by her mother Lily (Lauren Hutton) who has founded their company. They have launched a line of less expensive and more accessible cosmetics for sale at retails stores like Target  but they are not selling well  and the advertising campaign is tanking. Lily realizes that because of her wealth and beauty Avery has a disconnect with the product line and doesn\'t understand how to properly market it.The day after that  Renee runs into the woman from Soul Cycle at a Target store. She starts asking her about what it\'s like to be so beautiful  and while conversing  a man comes over. He interrupts them to flirt with the other woman  referred to Renee as a Target employee and calling her a man. He\'s extremely rude  and the other woman tells him she isn\'t going to give him her number. He leaves  and Renee marvels at what it must be like to have that happen all of the time.Later at work  there is a server issue  so Renee must print out a bunch of informational reports and hand deliver them to the downtown office. She arrives  and interacts with the beautiful but rude receptionist  who is just an intern. She sees Lily walk through the office and is in awe. She finds out that the company is looking for a permanent receptionist  and despite the fact that it would technically be a step down in both title and pay  she longs to have the job just to be around the beautiful and wealthy people.At home that night she is watching the Tom Hanks movie  Big.  It is the scene where he wishes to be bigger. In a moment of fancy  she runs outside into the rain and throws a coin into a fountain. She wishes to be beautiful. After making the wish  she looks into her mirror compact and is sad to see it did not come true.The next day Renee goes to Soul Cycle class. She makes sure to screw down her seat properly this time. The class instructor shouts out motivational phrases about destiny and miracles happening  and it seems as if she is being spoken to specifically. Shortly after starting the class  her shoe detaches from the cycle  and she falls and hits her head  ripping a clump of hair out in the wheel of another bike. She goes unconscious.When she wakes up  she is in a locker room. An employee (Sasheer Zamata) is looking over her. She offers an ice pack and a free bandanna. As Renee comes to  she starts to notice her limbs  starting with her legs and then arms. She seems to be reacting to them as if there\'s something wrong  and the employee is concerned. Renee then looks in the mirror and is stunned to see that she has transformed into an incredibly beautiful  physically fit version of herself. (Except she hasn\'t. She is hallucinating/imagining it. Everyone else still sees her as being overweight.)Now believing that the world sees her this way  she begins to behave with the confidence of a woman who has these features. She goes to pick up her dry cleaning  and behind her in line is Ethan (Rory Scovel.) They strike up a conversation  and Renee jokes that the dry cleaner calls out people\'s numbers at random. Ethan asks what her number is  and she believes he is hitting on her. She forces him to exchange phones so they can enter one anothers\' number in each others\' phone. Rory is bewildered by her confident  outgoing personality  even as she is handed her vomit-covered clothing (the dry cleaner couldn\'t get it out.)With her newfound confidence  Renee submits her resume for the receptionist position and is called in to interview. She goes into the office where everyone reacts to her as if they are surprised she is there. She takes this in the wrong way  assuming that she seems out of place because she is SO beautiful that she would never bother for such a position. She interviews with Avery and Helen (Naomi Campbell). They keep giving indicators that they don\'t think she\'s the right fit  but again she takes this to mean that they don\'t understand why she wouldn\'t pursue modeling  or confusion as to why she would take a step-down in pay. Because of her overwhelming confidence  she gets the job  but also Avery sees potential to have an  every woman  nearby from whom she can get advice on how to market their new budget cosmetics line.Renee meets up with her friends and tries to ease them into believing that it\'s her  believing they see the  new  version of herself. She tries to offer up facts only she would know  including that they all planned on getting 90210 themed tattoos (which Vivian did before the other two bailed.) Because she doesn\'t look any different  the two go along with the situation. The trio checks their dating app profile  but it has not even been viewed. Renee suggests they take a new photo with her new beautiful body as it will get more attention.Renee goes back to her old office and bids goodbye to Mason  who is attempting to take a dump while she speaks to him. She says he should have hit on her when he had the chance  and he begs her to leave him alone so he can finish. She leaves  and starts her new receptionist job. Renee goes into the job with confidence and a great attitude. She stocks fresh cold water in a mini fridge under her desk and provides visitors with a straw. A woman arrives for a meeting and based on how Renee looks  assumes she is in the wrong place  but Renee wins her over with a great attitude and friendliness.It turns out Grant LeClaire is observing Renee  and he approaches her to say hello. Renee is slightly overwhelmed and confesses that she knows about him and has followed him in the media. She even stocked a green health beverage in her mini fridge in case he came by  because she saw him drinking it in a tabloid. She jokes about the many women with whom he is linked  and fears he is offended  but he is clearly refreshed by Renee\'s great attitude. He even mentions how impressed he is that Avery hired her.Later Renee is bringing water on a tray to a staff meeting about the new budget makeup line and accidentally knocks a blush compact out of an employee\'s hand. She kneels down to pick it up and notices there is no applicator in the packaging. Avery gently scolds Renee  pointing out that if she were more familiar with the brand  she would know none of their blushers include applicators. Renee says that although she did know this  she just assumed a budget version would include one. She points out that the everyday woman buys these products and puts them on on-the-go  in many situations  and doesn\'t bring along brushes of her own. She may be doing so in the car  for instance  and is forced to apply with only he finger. Avery graciously thanks Renee for this valuable input. (Renee is never condescending or unkind to Renee  and her interest in what she has to say seems genuine and never an attempt to take advantage.)That evening Renee calls up Ethan and under the guise of making it easier for him to ask her out because of her beauty  she asks him out instead. He has no recollection of who she is. The two have a day out walking around together  and they end up at a beach bar that is having a bikini contest. Renee desperately wants them to go inside  so they do. Ethan says if she\'s into watching it  so is he  until she reveals she wants to enter and win the $500 prize. Ethan is concerned for her  and though he doesn\'t say it out loud  he is obviously worried she will be mocked or insulted. All the other contestants are very young and thin.Renee gets up on stage and wins the audience over with her rowdy  bawdy personality  doing a sexy dance on stage and even pouring water over her breasts. The crowd reacts positively  but she does not win the contest. Ethan admits that he is incredibly impressed by her confidence  and Renee says she doesn\'t care if she won the contest because she knows she\'s beautiful and she had fun. The two go back to Renee\'s place  and Renee quickly undresses and then shows off her body to Ethan as a  preview   to which he jokes she might not understand what a  preview  is. They head to bed  and Ethan leaves his shirt on and turns out the light. Renee turns it back on  and as they start to kiss  Ethan turns it off again. She turns it back on and asks if he doesn\'t want to see her. He says he very much wants to see her  but thought perhaps she wouldn\'t want to see him. She makes it clear that she does  and they make love. While doing so  Renee mounts him  and sees her reflection in the mirror over the bed and is very turned on by it. So is Ethan. After making love  they cuddle  and he again marvels at her confidence.An undetermined amount of time passes (probably around a month.)The next day at work  Avery rushes to Renee and begs for help. She confesses that she simply doesn\'t know how to market their new budget makeup line  and pleads with Renee to help spearhead the campaign and take on more responsibility. She also laments that no one takes her seriously (despite her advanced degree) because of her beauty and her baby voice  which she has tried to shed but cannot. Renee agrees to do so  and Avery asks her to come to a fancy dinner with the company bigwigs to discuss the situation. Renee says yes  and Avery says she should bring along a date (going through a comedic list of potential date genders in the process.) Renee says she does have someone to bring.Sometime later Renee and Ethan attend dinner at an upscale restaurant. All three members of the LeClaire family are there. Renee easily impresses Lily with her candor about the budget cosmetics line and insists that Renee come along to the major pitch meeting they are having with Target\'s people in Boston. It becomes clear that Grant is enamored with Renee.After dinner  Renee meets up with her friends and takes them to a Chinese restaurant where coworkers from LeClaire said a hidden speakeasy was located in the back. No one in the restaurant will tell them how to get to it  so the three sit down to dinner. Renee is somewhat rude to her friends  asking why they didn\'t dress up as she asked  and they brush it off. Suddenly a stream of models come in  and Renee rushes over to them to say hi. She comes back to her friends and reveals that only she herself would be allowed to go back  but she would only go if they\'re okay with it. They reluctantly say yes  and Renee disappears  leaving them alone.The next night Renee meets up with her friends again. The dating app has scored them a trio of men  and even though Renee now has Ethan  she agrees to play along. However  she is extremely rude and unkind to her friends  interrupting them when they try to connect with the men in conversation and essentially painting them as unattractive  boring people with  potential . The men are clearly put off by Renee  and her friends pull her aside and ask her why she\'s behaving this way. Renee really thinks she\'s being a great wing man and doesn\'t understand why they\'re upset  so she leaves.A few days later Renee boards a private jet to fly out to the Boston meeting. Avery is on the plane  and Renee attempts to go over her presentation  but Avery has taken sleeping pills. Renee moves back to sit with Grant  whose interest in her becomes even more obvious. Later  at the hotel  Grant knocks on Renee\'s door. He comes in and asks to order room service  claiming that Avery blocked his ability to charge to his own room which is next door. He is attempting to seduce Renee  eventually luring her into the bedroom where he tries to kiss her. Before he can do so  Renee gets a photo text from Ethan  and she snaps out of it. She shoves Grant out of the bedroom and runs into the bathroom claiming to have diarrhea. She turns on the glass shower and goes inside  but she runs into the glass and is knocked unconscious.When Renee awakens  she has a nasty bleeding wound on her forehead. She gets out of the shower and realizes she has missed her meeting with Avery to go over the presentation. She runs down to the hotel lobby  and she encounters Mason who has been brought along on the trip to handle A/V tech. He recognizes her  and she is horrified because based on her  new self   he should not. She looks in the mirror and discovers that she sees her old self again. Devastated that she has reverted to her  ugly  form  and knowing Avery and others will not recognize her  she gives her presentation to Mason and tells him to deliver it to Avery to do herself. Renee flees back home.At home  she gets a video call from Ethan  who is excited to see her again  but she hides off camera so he can\'t see her. She says she can\'t meet him because she injured her back on the plane  and he offers to come over to take care of her. She says he can\'t because her place is being fumigated for ants  and he says  in that case  he should come get her and take her elsewhere. She realizes her lies aren\'t adding up and agrees to a date on Saturday. She then proceeds to get extremely drunk in her grief over her  lost  beauty. She visits Vivian\'s house  and discovers Vivian and Jane are on a date with their two guys from the app. Vivian says Renee was cruel to them and doesn\'t want to see her  so Renee leaves in rejection.The next day Renee goes back to Soul Cycle and attempts to recreate her accident to be  beautiful  again  but it doesn\'t work. She encounters the beautiful woman from before who is now crying in the locker room. The woman says she has been broken up with and Renee is incredulous that beautiful people get broken up with at all. Renee calls the woman stupid (in a colloquial fashion ) and the woman is upset because she has been burdened with people assuming she is stupid her whole life. Renee apologizes  and the two make amends.The next morning Renee wakes up to numerous missed calls from Avery. In a voicemail  Avery says that she delivered the presentation in Boston but it didn\'t go well and she wishes Renee would come back and help her. That night Renee goes to the restaurant where she is supposed to meet Ethan. She assumes he will not recognize her  still believing that he fell in love with her  beautiful  version. She goes inside to a seat about 50 feet from him and texts  saying she is stuck at work and understands if he wants to bail. Ethan thinks she is playing some kind of sexy game  so he goes and sits next to her  pretending not to know her (while she thinks he  in fact  DOESN\'T know her.) He says he is waiting for his girlfriend  but maybe he could buy her a drink while they wait.Renee has an emotional reaction to him identifying her as  girlfriend   and asks him about his  girlfriend  (herself.) He says she is the smartest  most creative  most beautiful woman in the world. This breaks Renee\'s heart because again  she thinks she is talking about the way she BELIEVES he previously saw her. She flees the bar  and then calls him and breaks up with him  leaving him extremely confused.Renee decides to try and help Avery while simultaneously making amends with her friends. She calls her friends and begs them to attend the big launch party for the new cosmetics line. She then arranges with Mason to take control of the A/V  and when Avery comes out and struggles with her presentation  Mason cuts the sound and lights  and Avery leaves the stage. Renee then appears behind a transparent scrim  and attempts to jump through it three times (each time splatting against it instead.) Vivian and Jane arrive just in time to see this.Renee comes out on stage and puts up a photo of herself at the receptionist desk at LeClaire. She says that this is how everyone knows her  as a perfect beauty  but would they be surprised to see her looking like  this   and then put up another photo next to it of her working in the basement of the Chinatown office. But when Renee turns around and sees the photos  she sees that she looks the same. Suddenly she realizes that the magic spell never actually happened  and all along all of these people saw her the way she always was and not as some perfect beauty. She realizes that she accomplished everything simply being herself.Renee then gives an uplifting speech about how every woman deserves to feel beautiful. She talks about how young girls have perfect confidence that over time gets chipped away by the world  and that LeClaire aims to help women get back to that natural state of total self-esteem. She projects photos of numerous types of women of every size  color  and age  including Jane and Vivian. The presentation goes over splendidly. When she goes off stage  she apologizes to Avery. Avery says the presentation was weird but went over perfectly. She also points out the company has excellent mental health benefits  indicating Renee\'s job is still there for her if she wants it.Renee  now realizing Ethan fell in love with her just as she always was  rushes to his home. She buzzes his video intercom and begins explaining to him that she broke with him for her own reasons and not because of him. She also picks her nose  not realizing she is on video. He rushes out to her  and picks her nose for her  getting what she couldn\'t reach. They laugh and makeup  and embrace.The last shot is of Renee  at the Soul Cycle class. She is now exercising because she wants to improve herself  not out of any fantasy goal or wish for a miracle. The camera zooms in on her determined  smiling face as she rigorously rides  and fades to black.' , 'Change everything Without changing anything'  'Attitude is everything.'  'Feel pretty awesome.

Richard answers to hear his friend and employee  Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo)  crying for help  claiming he has been kidnapped in Mexico and that his abductors are demanding a ransom of US$5 million.We go back to two days earlier where Harold is merely a mild-mannered rep for Promethium  living in Chicago and married to Bonnie (Thandie Newton). He meets with his accountant  who tells him that because of Bonnie\'s reckless spending  they are broke. The accountant also tells Harold about an impending merger of his company with another larger firm  that would put Harold out of job. Harold believes Richard is his friend and wont do that to him. When he arrives at work  the Spanish speaking Harold is told by Richard that the two of them  plus Elaine  are going to be flying to Mexico to handle business involving a company merger  although Harold doesn\'t know that it\'s supposed to be a merger. Richard makes an allusion to a study he read on a gorilla being fed carrots when he wants bananas as a means for Harold to be convinced to go through with this so he will eventually be rewarded. Harold goes into Richard\'s office and finds a merger presentation file on his computer that he copies to his own drive.Elsewhere in the city is a guitar shop run by Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway). A friend of Miles  Nelly (Paris Jackson)  enters the shop to tell Miles that someone down in Mexico wants him to smuggle some drugs into the U.S. He agrees to it for US$20 000 and decides to take Sunny with him.\nHarold  Richard  and Elaine arrive in Mexico where they meet Angel (Yul Vasquez)  an old friend of Harold\'s from his previous visits to the company. They meet with their company rep named Celerino Sanchez (Hernan Mendoza). Richard and Elaine enter his office while Harold sits outside. It turns out they have been selling their latest product  medical marijuana in the shape of a pill to the Mexican cartel in order to earn more money  and now Promethium has decided to cut them off to avoid harming their merger.Later on  the three have dinner  with Harold secretly recording what Richard and Elaine say about him when he walks away. He learns that his wife is having an affair with Richard. At the hotel  he is having a Skype call with Bonnie where she admits to having an affair and that she plans to leave Harold.

Sanchez tells Villegas about them getting cut off by Promethium  and after showing Villegas a picture of Harold  the kingpin is led to believe that Harold is the boss  so he orders his men to go find him after having them cut off Sanchez\'s toe to show that nobody messes with them.Back at Promethium  Richard and Elaine promote their new product  a weed pill called Cannabax  to potential buyers Jerry (Alan Ruck) and Marty (Kenneth Choi). Elaine uses her sex appeal to sway the men into buying what she and Richard are selling.\nHarold is left behind in Mexico to handle other business. As the cartel goes looking for him  they find that he has left the hotel and is now staying at a smaller motel run by brothers Ronaldo (Diego Catano) and Ernesto (Rodrigo Corea).

A security guard who drops his coffee instigates the shootout accidentally. Police officers arrive on the scene and engage in a shootout with the robbers. Eventually  Merrimen and his crew escape with the empty armored truck  but he reprimands Bosco (Evan Jones) for killing the first guard. In the morning  Detective Nick  Big Nick  O\'Brien (Gerard Butler) investigates the crime scene. He has been monitoring Merrimen and his crew for a while. Nick is curious as to why Merrimen stole an empty armored truck. Suspecting a local bartender named Donnie for involvement  Nick finds him at the bar and kidnaps him for interrogation.In a flashback  Merrimen is planning to rob the Federal Reserve on Friday of that week by covertly removing about $30 million in old bills with deleted serial numbers before they are shredded. Merrimen has Donnie gain access into the Federal Reserve by posing as a Chinese food deliveryman. In the ceiling of the Bank\'s bathroom  he stashes an extra bag of food for the day of the big heist.At home  Nick\'s wife Debbie (Dawn Olivieri) discovers that Nick has been going behind her back seeing other women. Incensed  she leaves with their daughters and files for divorce. Nick spots Donnie and says hello at a restaurant with Merrimen and his crew.

To discourage further time-wasting communications  Merrimen has one of the crew take a hostage to a back room and shoot her. The police negotiator then agrees not to communicate again until the money and chopper are about to arrive in over an hour\'s time. The thieves then blow the vault open and escape through a hole in the floor before Nick\'s team come in. They also find that the shooting of the hostage was staged. The thieves needed commercial bank cash  so they can make a cash drop-off at the federal reserve: the only way to get inside the federal reserve building.Donnie is hidden inside a cash dolly delivered to the Federal Reserve building by Merrimen  and he slips out during a falsely tripped alarm to collect the targeted old bills that have been earmarked for shredding and he stashes them in bags in the refuse.

124.054597,2018,The First Purge,13,97,5.2,3031,20180704,0,0,0,1,1,0,1, 'The film opens with an insane junkie named Skeletor (Rotimi Paul) telling another man about his dark desires and instincts  and how he wants to purge to unleash his hatred of people. The other man likes Skeletor\'s use of the word  purge  and assures him that he will get to do just that very soon.Set in the mid 21st Century  it is a time of economic and social turmoil in the United States. The New Founding Fathers of America are established to replace both the democratic and republican parties. They plan to initiate an experiment on Staten Island within two days time to allow for citizens to release their inhibitions for a 12-hour period. This was concocted by Chief of Staff Arlo Sabian (Patch Darragh) and Dr. May Updale (Marisa Tomei). Those conducting and monitoring the experiment offer the Island\'s residents $5 000 to stay in their homes during the experiment  and an additional compensation to those who participate. The participants are given tracking devices and camera contact lenses to monitor their activity.In the next scene  we are introduced to drug lord Dmitri (Y\'lan Noel) as he tells his dealers that they will be making their way out of Staten Island on Purge Night. One dealer  Capital A (Christian Robinson)  says he wants to stay and purge  but Dmitri has his trusted friend Blaise (Siya) flip Capital A onto his back to reaffirm his orders.Elsewhere  a young dealer named Isaiah (Joivan Wade) has a run-in with Skeletor  who harasses him and says he\'s going after his sister on Purge Night. Isaiah shoves Skeletor  who retaliates by cutting Isaiah\'s neck with a razor before fleeing. Isaiah tends to his wound at home when he is found by his sister Nya (Lex Scott Davis)  who is advocating against the Purge. Nya goes to confront Dmitri  with whom she has some history. She is angry because she thinks that Dmitri has Isaiah dealing for him  but Dmitri says he never knew he was dealing and never would have taken him in like that.On the evening of the experiment  many people make their way off the Island via ferries. Nya joins her friends Dolores (Mugga) and Luisa (Luna Lauren Velez)  as well as Luisa\'s daughter Selina (Kristen Solis) at church where they will wait out the Purge. Nya thinks that Isaiah is with their uncle in Brooklyn  but he has stayed to participate in the Purge so he can go after Skeletor. Meanwhile  Dmitri has stayed in his office while Capital A has sent two hookers there to keep Dmitri company.Isaiah goes out into the streets with his gun. Skeletor has joined the Purge as well  and he finds a man trying to break open an ATM  and Skeletor stabs him to death. This is recorded as the very first Purge of the night. The footage goes viral quickly after the NFFA gets their hands on the video. They observe that there are more parties being thrown around the area compared to what they were originally expecting.Skeletor walks upon one of the Purge parties happening  which is just a rave going on in the middle of the streets. He stabs a few people to death before the crowd runs away in fear. Isaiah has him cornered and aims his gun at him  but he fails to pull the trigger  drops the gun  and runs away. Skeletor chases after him as Isaiah runs through bad neighborhoods where other murderous Purgers are running loose. He finds a quiet spot to call Nya for help  and she leaves to go find him.As Nya goes to look for Isaiah  Dmitri is visited by the hookers. As they seduce him  they quickly turn out to be Purgers who try to kill him. At the same time  we see Nya get caught by Skeletor  who tries to cut and rape her  but Isaiah stabs Skeletor in the back and runs away with Nya.

She stops at a gas station to get cigarettes  when the clerk receives a phone call. He turns to Giselle and asks  Truth or Dare?  Giselle is frightened and says she doesn\'t want to play anymore. Moments later  she takes a can of lighter fluid and matches  and she douses a nearby woman before apologizing and saying she has no choice. Giselle throws a match and lights the woman on fire.We then meet college student Olivia Barron (Lucy Hale) as she is making a video for her YouTube channel to encourage others to build homes for Habitat For Humanity. Her best friend Markie Cameron (Violett Beane) enters and asks Olivia if she is going to join her and their other friends in Mexico for spring break as will perhaps be the last time they get to spend this much time as a group before they graduate. Although initially reluctant  Olivia agrees to go.The girls join their other friends - Markie\'s boyfriend Lucas Moreno (Tyler Posey)  drug dealer Tyson Curran (Nolan Gerard Funk)  his sort-of alcoholic girlfriend Penelope Amari (Sophia Ali)  and Brad Chang (Hayden Szeto) - as they take a trip to Mexico  spending a lot of the time posting videos and pictures.The friends are at a bar where Olivia sees a drunken Markie dancing with another guy. She pulls her away before Lucas sees  as Markie has evidently been repeatedly unfaithful to him. Brad goes to hook up with a guy as he sees Tyson and Penelope going at it. Olivia goes to the bar where a schoolmate named Ronnie (Sam Lerner) approaches her and tries to hit on her. A nearby patron  Carter (Landon Liboiron)  tells Ronnie off and nearly gets into a confrontation with him until Olivia tells Ronnie people are doing shots nearby. Olivia and Carter then start to chat until her friends show up. They plan to go back to the room  but Carter convinces Olivia to get her friends to join them and go hiking up to a nearby mission.The group arrives at the mission  which has long been abandoned. Ronnie has followed them as well. Olivia walks by a broken urn with a skull on it and walks away because of a rotten smell. The group then sits to play a game  and Carter suggests  Truth or Dare . They have fun at first with dares like Ronnie having to give Tyson a lap dance  Lucas running around naked  and Penelope making out with Olivia  but it turns hostile when Olivia picks truth and Tyson asks her if Markie knows that she\'s always been in love with Lucas. When it gets to Carter  Markie asks him what his intentions are with Olivia. He straight-up admits that he needed to find someone who was an easy target and had plenty of friends that he could trick into going up there since he\'s okay with strangers dying if he gets to live. He starts to leave  and Olivia goes after him. Carter tells her that now they are in the game  and they have to follow the rules: Tell a lie  you die. Fail to do a dare  you die. Refuse to play  you die.Upon returning home  Olivia starts seeing  TRUTH OR DARE?  written on most things she comes across. She goes to look for Markie in the library and is then surrounded by other students whose faces morph into twisted grins with red eyes. They all chant  TRUTH OR DARE  until Olivia picks truth. She is asked to reveal what secret her friend is asking her to keep  and Olivia shouts to the whole library that Markie is constantly cheating on Lucas. He and Markie hear it  and he leaves. Olivia tries to explain herself to Markie  but she threatens to break her hand.That night at a bar  Ronnie tries to flirt with a fellow student named Alexis (Morgan Lindholm)  but she is quick to reject him. Her face then morphs and she hits him with a  Truth or Dare?  Ronnie picks dare  and Alexis tells him to show off his penis to the bar. He stands on the pool table to do so but then feels insecure when another girl mocks him for it. Ronnie then decides against the dare  so then his own face morphs  and he steps on a pool ball  causing him to slip and break his neck against the edge of another table.Olivia and her friends are in Brad\'s apartment where they see Ronnie\'s death on video. Olivia tries to convince her friends that the game is real  but nobody believes her. Lucas leaves after getting his things  and he walks by an alley where he hears a voice calling to him and asking him to play. He sees the question as graffiti on the wall  and it starts to get burned into his skin. Lucas then calls Olivia to say he believes her now  as he picked truth and was asked how he really feels about Olivia. He tells her that he sometimes imagines what it would be like to be with her instead  even though he knows it can\'t happen.The group gathers at the house that Olivia shares with Markie and Penelope to tell Markie that the game is real. They realize it is going based on the order in which they played. Markie gets a text since it\'s her turn  and she picks dare. She is dared to go through with her promise of breaking Olivia\'s hand. Olivia grabs a hammer and tries to get Markie to go through with it  although she is reluctant. Olivia gets her to do it when calling her father a coward (he killed himself and Markie is still dealing with that).Lucas and Brad take Olivia to the hospital. It\'s Brad\'s turn to play  and he picks truth. He is then forced to come out as gay to his father  Han (Tom Choi)  a homophobic police officer.

The others try to go after him to stop him  but the interviewer becomes possessed and forces Tyson to play. He picks truth and is asked to admit that he writes fake prescriptions to students. He denies it  and he then becomes possessed. Tyson sticks a pen in his eye and then slams his head against the wall to drive it in  killing him. The others see this  as well as the blood under the door.Penelope is still reeling from Tyson\'s death  so she starts drinking heavily. Unfortunately  it\'s her turn now  and when she tries to pick truth  the game demon tells her it doesn\'t work like that  and she must pick dare. Markie finds Penelope on the roof of the house after being dared to walk around the whole roof while downing the rest of her vodka. The others get a mattress to catch her in case she falls  while Lucas stands on the roof to try and help. Penelope gets closer toward a fence where she could get impaled if she falls  and the mattress will not break the fall. Olivia gets into her car and breaks the fence down. Penelope finishes the bottle and falls as Markie and Brad place the mattress on top of the car  catching her.The friends find out about Giselle and what she did. They get in touch with her through a fake Facebook account and demand to meet up with her so that she can explain to them what is happening. Giselle responds and sets up a meeting. The friends meet her by a warehouse. Giselle explains that she and her friends were at the mission where one of her friends  Sam  had been messing around and breaking things  which may have been how the curse started  and now all of her other friends are dead. The reason Penelope couldn\'t pick dare was because the pattern went  two truths and a dare . When they ask about Carter  she doesn\'t seem to know who they are talking about. Giselle then reveals that she was dared to kill Olivia. She aims a gun at her and shoots  but Penelope pushes Olivia out of the way and gets fatally shot instead.

She picks dare and is forced to sleep with Lucas. She tells Markie she picked dare so that her friends wouldn\'t have to. Markie leaves pissed  and Olivia admits to Lucas that she actually picked dare because there\'s a secret she is hiding from Markie that she can\'t bring herself to admit. She and Lucas start to make out and have sex until Lucas is up to play. He picks truth and must admit who he truly loves. He admits he loves Markie more. Olivia gets up and leaves.Markie is sitting outside a cafe watching a video of her and her father. The game demon takes her father\'s form and makes Markie play.

He is outside talking to his father  who says he still loves his son. They hug  but the game demon makes Brad pick dare. He is dared to snatch his father\'s gun and make him beg for his life. Olivia and Lucas try to run outside  but a nearby officer fatally shoots Brad.Olivia is at the precinct where she is once again questioned by the detective after they traced the IP address to the fake account and found the message to Giselle in which Markie threatened to stand outside her family\'s house until the game dared her to burn them like she did the woman from earlier. The detective mentions Sam and shows Olivia a picture of him. It\'s Carter.Olivia reunites with Markie and Lucas outside. It\'s Olivia\'s turn  and she picks dare  but the dare is for her to admit the secret she\'s been keeping from Markie. Olivia tells her that she was there the night of her father\'s suicide. She had gotten into a fight with her parents and went to Markie\'s house  but she wasn\'t there. Olivia drank with Markie\'s dad until he tried to come onto her.

Although the building is structurally complete  the construction process has been not without complications and the building has yet to be opened to the public.Marine war veteran and retired FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader  Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson)  now assesses security for skyscrapers. Although having one leg amputated from the knee down from a previous mission  he is fitted with a modern prosthetic leg  which keeps his full mobility. Sawyer is tasked with inspecting the Pearl  and his family - wife Sarah (Neve Campbell) and twin children Georgia (McKenna Roberts) and Henry (Noah Cottrell) move into the building.Sawyer confirms to Zhao  security directors Ajani Okeke (Adrian Holmes) and Sawyer\'s friend and fellow ex-FBI agent Ben Gillespie (Pablo Schreiber)  and insurance executive Mr. Pierce (Noah Taylor)  that the building\'s fire and security systems are secure  but he needs to inspect the off-site security center that controls the system. Zhao then hands Sawyer a tablet computer that gives full administrative access to The Pearl\'s computer systems that can only be unlocked by facial recognition.While heading to the off-site security center  a thief working for Kores Botha (Roland M??ller)  an international terrorist with ties to many major crime syndicates  attempts to steal the tablet from Sawyer but fails  resulting in Ben revealing that he too is working with Botha so that he can ruin Sawyer out of envy  before attacking Sawyer to steal the tablet himself. In the struggle Ben is mortally wounded and warns Sawyer that Botha\'s men will kill him for the tablet before he dies.As he leaves  Botha\'s subordinate Xia (Hannah Quinlivan) steals the tablet from Sawyer before infiltrating the security center and killing all the personnel there. Meanwhile  Botha and his men start a fire on the 96th floor of the building  triggering and activating the advanced computer-controlled fire extinguishing system installed throughout the skyscraper. A hacker at the security center then hacks the tablet  disabling the facial recognition and giving him access to The Pearl\'s security systems  locking out administrative access to The Pearl to Zhao and his team  as well as disabling all the fire extinguishing systems above the 95th floor  creating an impenetrable fire line that cuts off all rescue operations from below to assist the survivors on the upper floors. After doing so  Xia shoots the hacker.The local police  led by Inspector Wu (Byron Mann)  sends a team of officers to locate Sawyer  believing that he is involved with the incident at the skyscraper  and attempts to capture him as he makes his way to The Pearl. Sawyer  knowing that his family is trapped on the floors directly above the inferno  escapes from the police. He makes his way to a construction site adjacent to The Pearl  climbs a crane and leaps off it onto skyscraper  escaping Wu\'s team.Zhao and Okeke send two security guards to rescue Sarah  Georgia  and Henry from the fire  but the guards are killed in an explosion that destroys the nearby elevator  forcing them to navigate through the flames to an upper lobby. Zhao and Okeke  believing Sawyer\'s family to be dead  decide to evacuate all remaining personnel on board a helicopter at Pierce\'s suggestion  only for Pierce to reveal it to be a trap and that he works for Botha. Okeke and the other workers are killed by Botha\'s men  but Zhao escapes and seals himself in his penthouse. Pierce is ordered to capture Sawyer\'s family and he attacks them  but Sawyer appears in time to kill Pierce. Georgia becomes separated from her family in the chaos of the growing fire  but Sawyer manages to get Sarah and Henry to a partially functioning elevator. Sarah and Henry use the elevator for a free-fall escape with the plan to engage the emergency brakes to reach the ground safely. Upon reaching the ground floor  Sarah helps the police identify Botha as the ringleader. Sarah then explains to the police that she saw the terrorists carrying parachutes  which explains how the terrorists plan to escape from the building and helps identify a potential drop zone.When Sawyer finally locates Georgia  she has been abducted by Botha who uses her to negotiate his own escape from Sawyer and force him to capture Zhao. Sawyer is then forced to scale outside the building to a wiring panel to disable the doors to Zhao\'s penthouse. After entering the penthouse  Sawyer informs Zhao of his predicament as Zhao reveals the reasons for Botha\'s attack: halfway through the construction process  rival gangsters under the control of Botha decide to use their control of construction crews working on the skyscraper to extort millions of dollars in shakedown payments for preventing a massive strike of construction workers  potentially halting its progress. Zhao agrees to the shakedown payments  but not without carefully tracking and recording Botha\'s international money laundering scheme in his attempt to  legitimize  the funds he has extorted. Zhao believes that the memory card they have created containing the money laundering tracking information on Botha will provide them with insurance against any attempt by Botha to extort money from them a second time. Botha learns of the existence of the memory card and makes it a personal priority to retrieve the memory card in order to destroy it and the incriminating information it contains  because his bosses will kill him if he doesn\'t.Sawyer and Zhao plan to rescue Georgia while Sarah accompanies Wu and several other police officers to Botha\'s drop zone  where they engage in a shootout with Xia and Botha\'s men. Most of Botha\'s men are killed  while Sarah knocks Xia unconscious. Sawyer pretends to hand Zhao over to Botha  only for Zhao to distract him allowing Sawyer to rescue Georgia. Zhao  Sawyer  and Georgia escape to the top of the Pearl  where Botha and his remaining men follow them. Zhao and Sawyer kill Botha\'s men  but Botha injures Zhao and takes Georgia hostage. Sawyer attacks Botha and pushes him off a ledge  where Botha is killed by his own grenade  and he rescues Georgia.Sarah finds the stolen tablet dropped from Xia and discovers that she can override the shutdown of the fire extinguishing system built into the skyscraper by rebooting the entire computer system. The fire is rapidly brought under control  and a police helicopter rescues Sawyer  Georgia  and Zhao  who tells Sawyer he plans to rebuild the Pearl. Sawyer and Georgia reunite with Sarah and Henry  and the family leaves the premises.' , 'The sky is the limit.'   Don't Look Down.

He puts them in his mouth to tempt her until Marcie reveals they belong to Kayla (now played by Geraldine Viswanathan)  at which point he spits them out. Mitchell is very protective of Kayla  even snooping in her room after he finds a cigarette filter in her pants  and then finding a vibrating item that is soon revealed to be part of an electric toothbrush.At school  the girls sit together for lunch. Julie tells the other two that she plans to lose her virginity that night to her boyfriend Austin (Graham Phillips) because she thinks it will be special. Kayla decides to get in on it too with her prom date Connor (Miles Robbins)  though she cares less about it being a special thing. Sam (now played by Gideon Adlon) is more hesitant and says she and her prom date Chad (Jimmy Bellinger) might not go that far  but Sam appears more interested in a girl named Angelica (Ramona Young).Julie goes home and finds an acceptance letter from UCLA. She is nervous to tell Lisa since she thinks Julie was planning on going to school there in Chicago only 45 minutes away.At home  Sam gets ready for a pre-prom party at Julie\'s house. She talks to her mom Brenda (June Diane Raphael) and her African American stepdad Frank (Hannibal Buress). He tells Sam about how prom night is special in terms of being with friends and cherishing these memories. When she gets to the party  Sam tells Julie and Kayla that she wants in on the sex pact.The party starts  and Mitchell talks to Lisa since she hasn\'t returned his calls to hang out like they used to. Hunter shows up at the party uninvited in a limo that he rented for the girls. Lisa and Mitchell haven\'t talked to him since he divorced Brenda after he slept with Sam\'s babysitter  and Sam is none too happy to see him either. Mitchell meets Connor and immediately dislikes him for being near Kayla and for having a man bun.Before the girls leave for prom  Lisa finds Julie\'s acceptance letter in her drawer. She tries to talk to Julie before she leaves but is unable to work the letter into the conversation. Mitchell and Hunter join Lisa when they hear noises coming from Julie\'s laptop. They start reading the text messages from the girls\' group chat  which is filled with emojis that the adults know are for sexual terms. Their fears are confirmed when Julie writes  #SexPact2018   leading them to realize the girls are trying to lose their virginities that night. Lisa and Mitchell vow to stop this from happening  but Hunter thinks they are crazy for trying to do this. Still  he ends up joining them.The parents arrive at the prom to look for the girls. The girls themselves are enjoying the night with their dates  but Sam sees Angelica and strikes up a conversation with her. Angelica says she just broke up with her girlfriend  and she playfully touches Sam\'s hair  leading her to realize they may have mutual feelings.

When Ron and Cathy refuse to give up the address  Mitchell realizes that Marcie may have it.The three go to Mitchell\'s house to talk Marcie into giving up the address  but she thinks that it\'s stupid that they are so worried about the girls losing their virginities when it\'s like a rite of passage for guys. The three manage to distract Marcie long enough to acquire the address to the lake house. Upon arriving there  a couple of guys refuse to let the parents in until they trick Mitchell into doing a beer-chugging challenge.

They enter the house to find it ransacked. Jonathan and Florence decide to destroy the key  but it won\'t dissolve in the acid they dip it in.

Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) is the son of Stacker  but he doesn\'t see himself as anything like his dad. Jake is a former Jaeger cadet who now makes a living by dealing Jaeger parts in exchange for goods.Jake goes to a decommissioned Jaeger scrapyard with three thugs that he\'s hustled in search of a very valuable Jaeger core. The thug leader forces Jake at gunpoint to find it to pay off what he stole from him. Jake finds that the core is missing  but his tracker is picking it up. He tricks the thugs into a trap and chases after someone who already has the core. Jake finds that it\'s an orphan girl  Amara Namani (Cailee Spaeny). As the authorities arrive  Amara boards a Jaeger she built and calls Scrapper  and Jake follows. A Pan-Pacific Defence Corps Jaeger  November Ajax  chases after the two  but Amara pilots Scrapper to get them out. Jake tells her to use one of Scrapper\'s batteries to disable November  which works briefly  but the two are caught anyway.Jake and Amara are in a cell when Jake is called in to speak to Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)  who is the PPDC\'s General Secretary and Jake\'s adopted sister. She gives Jake a choice between going to jail or training new Jaeger cadets. Jake makes up his mind  and Mako says he\'s already set  and that Amara will be a cadet too.The two are sent to the Hong Kong Shatterdome to begin training. Jake meets his former co-pilot in Gipsy Avenger  Nate Lambert (Scott Eastwood)  with whom he now has a strained relationship with. Amara then learns that Jake is Stacker\'s son  as she is a fan of him and Jaegers in general. Jake also meets Jules Reyes (Adria Arjona)  a soldier that he becomes attracted to. Nate takes Jake and Amara to meet the other cadets  including Suresh (Karan Brar)  Ilya (Levi Meaden)  and Viktoria (Ivanna Sakhno)  or  Vik . She isn\'t happy that Amara has gotten into the program based off the PPDC being impressed by her building her own Jaeger  when it took Vik three tries to get in.The cadets begin their training by testing out their Drift compatibility. Amara doesn\'t do well at first and is discouraged. Jake and Nate talk in the kitchen and agree to stay out of each others\' way.The Shatterdome is visited by reps from Shao Corporations  including its CEO Liwan Shao (Jing Tian) and Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day)  who is now her Head of Research and Development. Their plan is to quickly deploy a large number of Jaeger drones around the world  which is viewed as a threat to the PPDC. Newt reunites with Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman)  who brings him to the PPDC\'s research lab to show him a vial of Kaiju blood  which may be essential in the development of the drones in making thruster pods. Hermann also tells Newt that he still has nightmares of when they drifted with the Kaiju brain. Newt then leaves to go reunite with Liwen  who tells him to stay away from Hermann so that she doesn\'t have to question his loyalty.Mako tells Jake how she doesn\'t trust the drone program because they are remote-operated and could be compromised or hacked. She tells him that she had it authorized for Jake to co-pilot Gipsy Avenger at an upcoming meeting in Sydney.Gipsy Avenger gets deployed in Sydney with Jake and Nate co-piloting. Suddenly  a rogue Jaeger  Obsidian Fury  rises from the ocean and begins to attack. Jake and Nate operate Gipsy to fight back.

Obsidian returns to the water.Jake returns to the PPDC  mourning Mako\'s loss. He meets with Amara  who offers her condolences. In order to help her out  Jake drifts with Amara  and he sees a memory of hers. She was on a boardwalk with her parents and brother when a Kaiju began to attack. When Amara tried to reach her family  they were crushed by the Kaiju. Jake has to snap her out of it and remind her not to hold on to the memory.At the Shao headquarters  Newt learns from Liwen that the drone program has been authorized in the wake of the Sydney attack. Newt considers the timing of this to be inconvenient. He returns home and starts talking to someone he calls Alice. Turns out  Alice  is a Kaiju brain in a pod that Newt frequently drifts with.At the PPDC  Amara and Vik get into a fight  with Amara actually managing to overpower Vik despite being half her size. The fight is broken up immediately by Nate. Jules enters to tell him that Hermann deciphered Mako\'s final message. It\'s the location of an old Jaeger facility in Zemlya where Obsidian may be operated from.Jake and Nate ride Gipsy to the facility  where Obsidian attacks again and destroys the facility. The two manage to overpower Obsidian this time and rip out its central core. Gipsy pulls off Obsidian\'s head to reveal that it was being operated by a Kaiju brain.Amara and a few cadets sneak into the wreckage of Obsidian Fury. Upon inspection  Amara finds a tube with a Shao logo on it. As she cuts into it  it leaks acid that severely burns another cadet\'s arm. She is subsequently kicked out of the program  to her disappointment. After she expresses that she doesn\'t belong  Jake tells her not to let what other people think of her define her. As Amara leaves  the other cadets express their regret  and Vik sincerely tells her to build her next Jaeger bigger.The drones are set to be deployed to PPDC Shatterdomes around the world. However  they are quickly taken over by Kaiju brains  making them look like Jaeger-Kaiju hybrids. They begin to attack the Shatterdomes  killing many and wrecking almost all the other Jaegers. Hermann rushes to find Newt to stop this  but when they reach the lab  Newt initiates a program in the drones to prepare them to open Breaches around the world to unleash more Kaiju. Newt has been planning this for the last decade after his mind has been corrupted by Precursors (Kaiju creators) after drifting with the Kaiju brains for so long. Hermann tries to stop him  but Newt gets away. The drones begin to open the Breaches  and Kaiju start to crawl out from the ocean depths. Liwen manages to shut the drones down and keep the Breaches closed  but three Kaiju have successfully gotten out and are making their way into Japan.In the lab  Hermann and the others determine that the Kaiju are headed to Mt. Fuji because it contains rare earth elements  and when mixed with Kaiju blood  will create a violent reaction that sets off the Ring of Fire and activates all nearby volcanoes to destroy humanity and bring forth more Kaiju. The PPDC gets set on bringing in reinforcements to repair Jaegers and get the cadets ready for battle.Jake and Nate meet with the cadets and prepare them with a speech from Jake  much like his father did in the past. He and Nate board Gipsy Avenger  while Amara joins Vik and another cadet in Bracer Phoenix  along with Guardian Bravo and Saber Athena joining. They lift off using Hermann\'s rocket thrusters with the Kaiju blood and rare earth elements as fuel.The three Kaiju are already attacking the city. The Jaegers arrive and start fighting back. Unfortunately  Newt uses his tech to merge the beasts into one Mega-Kaiju. This one proves to be insanely powerful  causing casualties within Guardian and Saber. It manages to overpower all the Jaegers before it starts heading toward Mt. Fuji. Nate is severely injured  and Bracer is down as well. Nate ejects himself to allow Amara to join Jake for them to co-pilot Gipsy. Liwen arrives with Scrapper and uses the last rocket to help Gipsy head toward Mt. Fuji.The Mega-Kaiju moves closer and closer toward the volcano. The cadets decide the only way to stop it is to send Gipsy soaring right into it. Once they reach a high enough altitude  Gipsy is sent hurtling toward the beast. Jake and Amara struggle to free themselves  but Scrapper gets them out in time. Gipsy collides powerfully with the Mega-Kaiju  sending it rolling down the mountain until it dies. Newt tries to initiate Plan B  only to get knocked out by Nate. Jake and Amara land safely and celebrate their victory.The last scene shows Newt in custody  vowing revenge and swearing that the Kaiju will return and that the Precursors will destroy the world. Jake enters and promises that humanity will be ready to fight back  bigger and badder than ever.' , 'Rise up.'  'The bigger they come  the harder we fight.'  'A new generation will rise up.'

Captain Hogie (Steve Carell) is flying through the skies  trying to fight off German soldiers until his plane is shot down  causing him to crash-land. His feet catch fire and his shoes are ruined. Hogie then finds a briefcase with women\'s clothing inside  but he is most partial to the high heels  and he wears them. He walks until he comes across a group of Nazis who proceed to mock him for his shoes. Hogie kicks the Nazi captain in the groin before the others start to gang up on him and beat him. Before they can finish him  a team of gun-toting women emerge and shoot the Nazis dead. Hogie approaches one of the women  Wendy (Stefanie Von Pfetten). In real life  Hogie\'s creator and counterpart Mark Hogancamp is trying to take a picture of the scene outside  but is interrupted when a truck outside ruins the scene.Mark puts the Wendy doll away along with other Nazi dolls he has deemed  dead . He takes out a doll of a Belgian witch he calls Deja Thoris (Diane Kruger)  which is a parallel of Mark\'s pill addiction. Across the street  Mark sees that a new neighbor  Nicol (Leslie Mann)  is moving in. She is approached by her obnoxious ex-boyfriend Kurt (Neil Jackson)  and Nicol tries to tell him to go away.Mark lives alone and suffers from PTSD as a result of a violent homophobic beat-down he received from five neo-Nazis (which the doll Nazis are based off of) after telling them he likes to wear women\'s shoes. He is visited once a month by his Russian caretaker Anna (Gwendolyn Christie). She  like many people in Mark\'s life  knows of Marwen and the fact that one of the dolls is based off of her. Mark goes through scrapbooks and photo albums to try and get a sense of what his life was before the beating. He was married to a real-life Wendy at one point. Another set of photos show him in rehab with Julie (Janelle Monae)  an Iraq vet who lost one of her legs out there.Back in Marwen  Hogie meets a French milkmaid named Elsa (Siobhan Williams). He brings her back to the bar where he reconvenes with Anna  Julie  Carlala (Eiza Gonzalez)  Roberta (Merritt Wever)  and Suzette (Leslie Zemeckis). Elsa tries to thank Hogie with a kiss for helping her  but she is gunned down by a Nazi in a tower. The other women grab their guns and fire upon the Nazi  who falls from the tower and splits in two. Hogie tries to save Elsa  but she passes on. Moments later  Deja arrives and zaps Elsa into non-existence  terrifying the other women. It is because of Deja\'s magic that the Nazis also don\'t stay dead.Mark receives a phone call from his lawyer  who reminds him that the sentencing for his assailants is later that week  and it is imperative that Mark attend and face his attackers. The whole thought of it terrifies Mark and sends him into a panic.Mark goes to a bar where he helps out (the same place where he was attacked)  and where the real Carlala works. He asks about Wendy  who also used to work there (she was the one who found him after the assault)  and Carlala tells him that Wendy moved to somewhere in California.Later  Mark goes to a doll store where the real Roberta works. She invites him out to dinner later in the week  but he makes excuses for not wanting to go. He picks out a doll that is supposed to be based off Nicol. Roberta offers Mark a limited edition Nazi doll  which starts to trigger Mark\'s anxiety again. He accidentally presses his hand down on the remote  which raises the volume on the TV just as a news report on the sentencing and Mark\'s attack is playing. It freaks him out and he runs out of the store without taking anything.Roberta goes to Mark\'s house to give him the doll  while also noticing that he is in the middle of a scenario in which her top has come off (again). Nicol overhears their conversation and walks to the back to introduce herself. Roberta realizes that this is the same woman Mark named the other doll after. Mark shows Nicol his models in Marwen and explains their roles in his life  as well as how  Marwen  is a combination of Mark and Wendy  although we later find out that Suzette is just based off a porn actress Mark fancies.Mark later makes his Nicol doll and incorporates her into a scenario in which Captain Hogie is taken by the Nazis  so Nicol joins the other women in a rescue mission. They find the Nazis and throw Molotov cocktails at them  burning them to death.Roberta picks Mark up during the week to bring him to the courthouse for the sentencing. As the judge speaks to the attackers  Mark starts to picture everything in a Marwen-esque scenario where the Nazis starts shooting everyone in the place. Mark freaks out and flees the courtroom. His lawyer talks to the judge for a recess  but she postpones the sentencing until later in the month.Mark starts to spend more time with Nicol  falling in love with her. This is paralleled in Marwen where Hogie and Nicol fall in love  but Hogie is too scared to let anyone in his life. Mark visits Nicol\'s house where she gives him muffins  but the moment is ruined when Kurt comes by to be a dick and taunt Mark over the dolls after he saw them in his backyard.Mark later tries to propose to Nicol with a Purple Heart medal as their Marwen figures did  but Nicol tries to clarify that she only sees Mark as a friend. Without a word  Mark leaves when Nicol has her back turned.The strain from reality becomes too much for Mark  and he contemplates suicide by overdose. This carries on into Marwen where Nicol is shot and is in critical condition. The other Marwen women tend to her just before the Nazis  now led by Kurt\'s counterpart Major Meyer  start to attack. A battle rages on until Hogie is found by Deja in a time machine (that is supposed to look like the DeLorean)  where she appears to try and help  but Hogie finds out she has been a spy for the Nazis and has been keeping them alive. Hogie defies her and says he is free from her power. Meyer tries to shoot Hogie but instead shoots Deja  causing her to blast herself into the future and also causing the Nazis to die. Nicol also turns out to be alive.Mark returns to the courthouse with his friends there to support him. He reads a statement aloud to everyone  but mostly addressing the Nazis. He says that although they took something personal from him  they can no longer hurt him since he has his art and his friends. This even brings some of the neo-Nazis to tears.Mark later attends a photography exhibit featuring his work on Marwen  which he has now renamed Marwencol to honor Nicol. She shows up briefly and smiles at Mark after viewing his work. He then makes plans with Roberta to get sushi.Mark is then seen walking home with his dolls while wearing high heels.There is a final text stating that Mark Hogancamp lives in upstate New York and continues to expand the world of Marwencol. We then see a picture of Mark with his own little Captain Hogie.' , 'The Director of FORREST GUMP Invites You to a Most Unexpected Place'   You Can't Put This Hero in a Box

The much larger predator city of London goes after the smaller town via the Hunting Grounds as the wealthy and well-kept citizens of London cheer like it\'s a sport. The other people in the small town panic while Hester runs to the front  waiting to be absorbed by London  as she has her eyes set on London\'s Head of the Guild of Historians  Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving). Within a matter of moments  Salzhaken is brought inside London.A young Apprentice Historian named Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) meets with Valentine\'s daughter Katherine (Leila George) as they check out London\'s little museum of  old tech  (smartphones  toasters  computers  etc) where Tom is sent by his boss  Chudleigh Pomeroy (Colin Salmon) to pick up some tech. They watch a brief video in which a bio-weapon called MEDUSA was the cause of the destruction brought on by the Sixty Minute War. Tom is sent away by the snooping Chief Navigator named Herbert Malliphant (Andrew Lees) to London\'s lower level so that he can spend a moment with Kate  but she ends up accompanying Tom to his destination.The people of Salzhaken are brought in for processing. Valentine descends to oversee things as one of the guards assaults a man from the small town. Hester gets closer to Valentine  which Tom manages to see. He calls out to Valentine to warn him  but Hester manages to stab Valentine quickly. She pulls off her scarf to reveal her facial scar and tells Valentine this is for her mother Pandora. Before she can kill Valentine  she is stopped by Tom  who chases her to a waste chute. Hester is about to jump until Tom grabs her wrist. She tells Tom to ask Valentine what he did to her mother and how he gave Hester her scar before she lets herself free of Tom\'s grip and falls down the chute. Valentine arrives moments after  and Tom starts to ask what Hester meant by what she said. Valentine responds by pushing Tom down the chute right before Kate and other people arrive  telling them that Tom fell in as a result of fighting Hester. Kate notices that another man  Bevis Pod (Ronan Raftery)  saw the whole thing.Hester and Tom are dropped on the outskirts of an unknown location. She picks his pockets and steals his money and knife before heading off on her own. Tom wakes up and follows Hester  thinking they should stick together  but she wants nothing to do with him. Not long after  they are spotted by scavengers and taken into a town called Scuttlebug.Valentine speaks to London\'s mayor Magnus Crome (Patrick Malahide) over his plans for where to take London  but Crome has his doubts over whatever Valentine is planning  due to London living by the philosophy of Municipal Darwinism. Valentine then goes to visit his top scientist Dr. Twix (Sarah Peirse) as she is in the process of developing a weapon for Valentine. She also offers Valentine a solution for dealing with Hester.Kate goes to find Bevis and ask what he saw. He is hesitant to say since he knows it will get him in trouble  but he finally admits to Kate that he saw her father push Tom down the chute. What\'s more is Bevis knows that Valentine is covering something up and is building something inside St. Paul\'s Cathedral  and the two try to figure out a way to get inside.The people that take Hester and Tom in appear hospitable  but they keep the two locked in a cell. Hester then tells Tom about how she lost her mother when she was 8. Valentine was good friends with Pandora (Caren Pistorius) and always treated Hester kindly until the day that Pandora and Valentine both found something that Pandora knew Valentine wanted for his own dark purposes. They fought over it  and Valentine stabbed Pandora in front of Hester and slashed Hester\'s face when she tried to save her mother. Before dying  Pandora gave Hester a necklace with an eye symbol  and Hester escaped.Valentine goes to an offshore prison to find Shrike  who is a half-cyborg/half-zombie-like creature who has a history with Hester. He is angry with her for going back on a promise she made to him  and he wants her dead. Valentine destroys the prison and lets Shrike run free to go after Hester.Hester and Tom are brought before an auction in Rustwater where they are to be sold off as slaves. When Hester is brought up for purchase  a woman named Anna Fang (Jihae) steps out and claims she will take Hester. The auctioneer knows that Anna is a fugitive wanted by London with a price on her head  but Anna frees Hester and Tom after killing the auctioneer and several of his men. They board her aircraft  the Jenny Haniver  but they are also spotted by Shrike. He attempts to climb up and catch them as Tom is climbing the rope to the aircraft.

After running away as a child  Shrike found her and raised her for years like his own. He had always noticed how sad Hester was  and he offered a solution to make the pain go away. Shrike revealed a robotic body he made for Hester  so that she can die and be reborn as a machine with no memory of the horrors of her childhood. She almost took him up on the offer until she heard about Valentine being close  so she headed off to hunt him down and left Shrike alone and angered by her deception.Anna brings Hester and Tom to Airhaven  where they meet her partners in the Anti-Traction League. She tells Hester that Pandora was trying to hide something from Valentine. Meanwhile  Kate and Bevis do more investigating by speaking to Pomeroy. He quietly leads them through a tunnel into the cathedral where Kate sees the large MEDUSA weapon that Valentine is holding. She also watches as he shoots down Crome when he finds the weapon himself. Anna and her team are trying to find a way to stop the weapon  as Valentine is planning to bring it to Shan Guo  a non-mobile city that was formerly China  and destroy the wall that seals it off before taking down the rest of the city. Just then  Shrike enters and starts to attack and kill Anna\'s teammates. Airhaven starts to go down in flames as the survivors try to escape. Shrike goes after Hester and Tom and nearly kills Tom until Hester pleads with him to leave Tom. Shrike realizes Hester is in love with Tom. He also notices he has been heavily damaged in the fight  and he is going to die for good. He releases Hester from her promise and lets her go. She tearfully leaves him  and Shrike\'s final thoughts are of Hester as a child. She and Tom escape with Anna and a few others.Valentine prepares to take London toward Shan Guo. Anna talks to Governor Kwan (Kee Chan) to help launch the Anti-Tractionist fleet against London. The heroes fly toward London as they inch closer and closer to the wall. Valentine raises MEDUSA to fire the first powerful blast against the wall. Kate sees what kind of man her father truly is  and she refuses to side with him. Many of Anna\'s teammates are shot down and killed as another blast hits the wall. Hester and Anna manage to make it to London and head to St. Paul\'s. Hester finds that her mother\'s necklace holds the kill drive for MEDUSA. Valentine and Anna fight as Hester goes to shut down MEDUSA before the final blast can fully take the wall down. Valentine fatally impales Anna  but she lives long enough to see MEDUSA shut down.Valentine still plans to ram London into the wall at the cost of millions of lives. Kate tries to stop London\'s engine  but it won\'t budge. Tom flies the Jenny Haniver toward the engine to blast it to bits  causing London to slow down. Valentine tries to get away on his own aircraft until Hester pursues him. He reveals to her that he is her father  having been in love with Pandora before her death. When Hester has a chance to kill Valentine  she chooses not to. She hops on the Jenny Haniver with Tom before he fires a blast at Valentine\'s craft  sending it crashing to the ground. Valentine survives  but only long enough to see that London\'s tracks are about to crush him. Hester sighs upon looking at this and laughs in victory.Kate leads the Londoners to the top of Shan Guo\'s wall where she peacefully greets Kwan  and he accepts them in for sanctuary.

A submersible is sent down to retrieve the bones  and it sends them up on a buoy before it is attacked by the Mosasaurus. The people on land who opened the gate to the lagoon lose contact with the submarine pilots. The gate starts to close and a Dilophosaurus can be heard running away in the jungle. The trees nearby shake and Jurassic World\'s veteran Tyrannosaurus Rex attacks the group. Jack (Robert Emms) is left on the ground and their helicopter lets down a rope ladder. They escape the Tyrannosaurus  but Jack is then swallowed by the Mosasaurus after it jumps into the air and escapes from its enclosure.It then cuts to the mainland  in the year 2018  where Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard)  the former park manager  has now founded the Dinosaur Protection Group  an organization dedicated to saving and protecting dinosaurs. After the government refuses to fund a rescue operation to save the dinosaurs  alongside Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum)  Claire meets Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell)  an old business partner of John Hammond  who agrees to fund the rescue mission and bring the dinosaurs to a new sanctuary island where they will be left to live on their own  safe from human interference. Lockwood\'s assistant  Eli Mills (Rafe Spall)  asks Claire to recruit Owen Grady (Chris Pratt)  a former raptor trainer who worked at the park  to find and capture Blue  the last surviving Velociraptor. Claire recruits Owen to help her rescue the remaining dinosaurs from the island.Claire and Owen then set off on a charter plane with Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda)  a paleo-veterinarian  and Franklin Webb (Justice Smith)  an IT expert  both from the Dinosaur Protection Group. Once their plane lands  the group is surprised to find a large base camp has already been set up  and they are met by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine)  a big game and trophy hunter. They all set off along with a group of mercenaries to reactivate an abandoned radio communications tower that they will use to find the dinosaurs via their RFID chip implants. Along the way while passing through the Jurassic World main street  they encounter a Brachiosaurus.Owen  Zia  Wheatley  and some of the mercenaries go to find Blue. Owen suggests that he set out on his own to find Blue  and the others stay behind at the truck. When Owen comes upon the fallen Explorer 04 near the old Tyrannosaur Paddock from the first Jurassic Park  Blue jumps out and Owen tries to bond with her before she is tranquilized by Wheatley and his mercenaries. Angry  Blue tackles a mercenary and kills him but not before drawing his sidearm and shooting her  much to Wheatley\'s and Owen\'s dismay. Owen tries to attack Wheatley but Wheatley tranquilizes him and threatens to shoot Zia. Zia says that she is the only one who can keep Blue alive and Wheatley has his men put their weapons down.Mt. Sibo erupts  causing the mercenaries protecting Claire and Franklin to panic and drive off  locking them inside the old communications center. A Baryonyx surprises them by crawling through an old tunnel  but is temporarily held at bay by falling lava. Franklin and Claire narrowly escape through an emergency ladder and lock the Baryonyx inside the communications center. Owen awakes from his unconsciousness but is still mostly immobile. He is surprised by a Sinoceratops  which plays with him for a little while before getting scared off and running away from the approaching lava which crawls toward Owen but he manages to (barely) escape just before he is engulfed by the lava. He runs into Claire and Franklin and yells at them repeatedly to  Run   the three elude the lava and falling debris and magma bombs while avoiding getting trampled by the stampeding dinosaurs.Franklin and Claire both hide inside a Gyrosphere  when a Carnotaurus appears and fights a Sinoceratops  before being pinned down and killed by the T. Rex who also makes a run for it. Franklin  Claire  and Owen make a run from the burning ash  Owen is slowed down a bit by the ash  but Claire and Franklin fall off the edge with several other dinosaurs. The magma bombs break the Gyrosphere  and Claire and Franklin almost drown  but are able to survive when Owen opens one of the doors using his survival knife. Crawling up on the beach  they see several of the dinosaurs  such as the Baryonyx and T. Rex all being captured  The mercenaries on the ship called the Arcadia begin caging all of the captured dinosaurs  Wheatley takes a pair of pliers and yanks a tooth out of a tranquilized Stegosaurus  Owen  Claire  and Franklin also see Blue being tended to by Zia who has been captured  then the three use a truck to drive on the ship  which is leaving the island  they only barely make it  and watch the island burn up in the background. A trapped Brachiosaurus calls out to the departing ship before being engulfed by the ash and perishing.Eli is disappointed by the lack of progress  and meets with Gunnar Eversol (Toby Jones)  an auctioneer who plans to sell the dinosaurs with for money. Lockwood\'s apparent granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon) overhears their conversation and learns of their plan. Eli takes Gunnar to a lab  where he reveals that they are creating a new dinosaur with Indominus Rex  Smurfette\'s clay model and Velociraptor called the Indoraptor  and potentially other improvements in its wake for the sake of military interests and warfare. With the current one being a prototype  and their plan to use it for militaristic purposes. Maisie attempts to tell Benjamin  but he seemingly believes she misheard them and sends her off to bed.Owen  Claire  and Franklin meet up with Zia  who believes they need Blue for something; Zia further tells them that before she can treat Blue\'s gunshot wound  she needs a ready blood transfusion for Blue just in case. Unfortunately (much to Claire\'s charging)  the only blood match on the ship would belong to a tranquilized T. Rex on board and inside one of the transport trucks  so Zia sends both Owen and Claire to retrieve some of the live dinosaur\'s blood. They find the Tyrannosaur and successfully get her blood but are locked in by some of the guards as the T. Rex wakes up. As the agitated animal begins to freak out and thrash violently  Claire escapes through the top and opens the main doors of the cage; Owen narrowly escapes the T. Rex\'s snapping jaws before she can bite him in half. The crew gives the blood to Blue before they make a dash; unfortunately  Franklin is caught and mistaken for a mercenary  and is forced to help transfer the dinosaurs to Lockwood Manor. Owen and Claire sneak into a truck but are discovered by Wheatley and imprisoned in the basement of Lockwood Manor.Maisie  having observed Mills entering the entrance code for the mansion\'s elevator the previous day  secretly enters the laboratory and watches several clips of Owen training the Velociraptors on Isla Nublar. Her exploration is interrupted by Mills and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong); the latter is extremely stressed about Blue\'s condition. Maisie  in an attempt to escape the two men  backs into a corridor and encounters the caged Indoraptor  who reaches out and gently strokes her hair from behind. Maisie screams  alerting the attention of Mills  who angrily escorts her upstairs and locks her in her bedroom.Lockwood confronts Mills about the latter\'s true intention of selling the dinosaurs in an auction  angered that Mills has crossed him and used his own mansion as the auction\'s venue. Ordered by Lockwood to call the police himself  Mills instead murders Lockwood by smothering him with a pillow.Bidders soon arrive for a dinosaur auction and place their bids on various species of dinosaurs captured by the team on the island  including an Ankylosaurus  a juvenile Allosaurus  a Baryonyx  and multiple others. After being captured by Wheatley  Owen attracts the attention of a Stygimoloch  causing her to break through the wall and eventually break through the doors of Owen and Claire\'s cell allowing them to escape. Meanwhile  in the auction room of Lockwood\'s estate  Eversol and Mills show the crowd the prototype Indoraptor  emphasizing that the animal is not for sale. Amazed by the creature\'s ability to lock onto a specific target (courtesy of a laser and an acoustic signal on a gun)  the attendees begin to bid on the Indoraptor. Eversol is coaxed by Mills to accept bids  much to Wu\'s disdain as the prototype Indoraptor lacks Blue\'s genome - and thus can neither empathize nor follow more specific orders.Owen and Claire encounter Maisie  who has escaped her room and discovered her dead grandfather and the three enter the auction room as the Indoraptor is being displayed. Understanding that the Indoraptor is far too dangerous to be sold  Owen disrupts the auction\'s proceedings with the aid of the Stygimoloch and wreaks havoc among the spectators  causing Mills and Eversol to end the auction. Owen bests several mercenaries in hand-to-hand combat  then reverses a switch that prevents the Indoraptor\'s cage from exiting the auction room.Later in the evening  Wheatley enters the deserted auction room and notices the Indoraptor. Having never seen the creature before and wanting one of its teeth for his necklace  Wheatley shoots the Indoraptor with two tranquilizer darts and enters the cage after the Indoraptor appears to be sedated. In reality  the Indoraptor is unaffected by the tranquilizer darts; he smiles and distracts Wheatley by waving his tail in the air before severing Wheatley\'s right arm and devouring him  his death is witnessed by Eversol who makes a dash for the elevator (without being spotted by the hybrid)  where all the other executives were hiding  but pushes a woman out of the way so he can access the code to close the elevator  causing her to scream at the sight of the Indoraptor  who rushes at the still open elevator but the doors successfully close before the Indoraptor can reach them; however  the hybrid (either with intent or by chance) uses its tail to cut off the power supply to the auction room  which automatically reopens the elevator door. The Indoraptor then proceeds to maul Eversol and the other executives to death.Owen reunites with Claire and Maisie and the three encounter Mills and two security guards in the mansion\'s basement. After unsuccessfully trying to coax Maisie to come with him  Mills angrily and cruelly reveals that Maisie is actually a clone of Lockwood\'s beloved daughter who had perished in a car accident many years prior. As Owen  Claire  and Maisie process this revelation  the Indoraptor suddenly appears and kills the two security guards  prompting the others to flee.Meanwhile  Zia and Franklin continue to tend to Blue in Wu\'s laboratory. Zia reveals to Wu that she had given Blue a transfusion of T. Rex blood  infuriating Wu  as it would now be impossible to create an Indoraptor with Blue\'s pure but now apparently  T. Rex blood-tainted  genome. Franklin injects 20 cc\'s of Carfentanil into Wu\'s neck  incapacitating him  before the two are apprehended by a pair of gunmen. Franklin frees Zia from being cuffed to Blue\'s cage  and Zia frees Blue. As Zia and Franklin flee to safety  Blue kills the two gunmen and escapes the laboratory before a massive explosion occurs - the brief battle had caused damage to several tanks of hydrogen gas within the laboratory.Owen  Claire  and Maisie take refuge on the main floor of Lockwood\'s mansion  in the skeleton and replica display room. They notice a human corpse on the ground near an Agujaceratops skull; as they approach it  the Indoraptor reveals himself and pulls the corpse farther behind the skull. The three protagonists take refuge against one of the walls of the skull\'s casing  but the Indoraptor successfully locates their vantage point by tracking their scent and climbing on top of the Agujaceratops skull. The Indoraptor chases Owen  Claire and Maisie up a spiraling staircase before the three escape into a power supply room  where Owen turns off the entire mansion\'s power.Zia and Franklin discover a hydrogen cyanide leak near the laboratory  which will kill all of the dinosaurs if it spreads to the caging area. Franklin resets the control system in order to restore power to the mansion. At this time  Owen  Claire and Maisie are hiding behind a diorama of a Velociraptor and Dilophosaurus engaged in battle near a glass wall. Maisie soon realizes that she is staring into the face of the Indoraptor through the glass wall and shrieks in terror; the Indoraptor breaks the wall and pursues the group once again  injuring Claire\'s leg with his toe claw in the process. The Indoraptor chases Maisie up another staircase and down a hallway until Maisie escapes up to her bedroom  where she takes refuge in her bed.Owen is urged to take care of Maisie by the injured Claire; the two share a passionate kiss before Owen leaves to search for Maisie. The Indoraptor  who by this point has ascended to the mansion\'s roof  lets out a demonic screech and descends the building until he reaches the windows leading to Maisie\'s room. Hanging upside down  the Indoraptor opens one of the windows and enters Maisie\'s room  slowly approaching her bed as she begins to shiver and cry. Just before the villainous hybrid attacks  Owen enters Maisie\'s bedroom and shoots the Indoraptor multiple times with live ammunition. The Indoraptor is unaffected and stands back up to face Owen. Blue enters Maisie\'s bedroom and confronts the Indoraptor; the two begin a vicious fight as Owen and Maisie escape the bedroom.The Indoraptor fends off Blue and traps Owen and Maisie on the glass roof of the display room. Just before the Indoraptor pounces  Claire appears and coaxes him into attacking Owen with the laser and acoustic signal on the same gun used in the auction demonstration. The Indoraptor charges towards Owen and falls through the glass roof; however  he manages to grab ahold of a rafter connecting the glass panes together and pulls himself back atop the roof. Blue suddenly appears and jumps onto the Indoraptor  causing both to fall down into the display room. The Indoraptor falls directly onto the horns of the Agujaceratops skull  which impales and kills him  while Blue lands on top of the hybrid\'s corpse and escapes. Franklin and Zia enter and reunite with Owen  Claire  and Maisie  and the five protagonists escape the battleground.However  a new issue looms; the dinosaurs are trapped in a room that is flooded by noxious hydrogen cyanide. Claire releases all of the dinosaurs\' cages one by one. Claire puts her hand on the red button that would release all of them from the entire building  but Owen discourages Claire from doing so  thus making Claire resist because she does not want the dinosaurs to destroy the world. However  Maisie pushes the button anyway  releasing the captive dinosaurs  and allowing them to escape to the mainland  exclaiming   They\'re alive  like me. As Mills is about to put the Indominus Rex fragment into the car  a stampede sound can be heard. As one of the men goes to investigate  a Pteranodon snatches and drops him onto Mills\' car  killing him. The now free dinosaurs begin to stampede out of the mansion  trampling another guard to death. Mills immediately takes refuge under the car  which is quickly trampled and destroyed in the stampede. As Mills gets up from underneath his wrecked car and tries to pick up the I. Rex fragment  the T. Rex suddenly appears and snatches him in her jaws  brutally shredding him before tearing him in half with a Carnotaurus  and ultimately devouring Mills  the T. Rex then knocks over the Carnotaurus with her head scaring it off in the process. The T. Rex triumphantly roars and walks away  destroying the I. Rex fragment in the process and ensuring that no carnivorous hybrid can ever wreak havoc upon the world again.\nOwen  Claire  Franklin  Zia  and Maisie all exit through the entrance of the Lockwood Manor  where Blue reunites with Owen  and even touches Owen\'s hand. Owen instructs Blue to accompany him; however  Blue denies him  as she would rather run free on her own than be kept in a cage again.Ian sums up his speech  as a sequence of shots are displayed such as the Mosasaurus attacking surfers  the T. Rex roaring at a lion in a zoo  Owen  Claire  and Maisie are seen driving down the highway to an unknown destination  and Blue is shown running and jumping onto a cliff overlooking a suburban neighborhood below  signifying that dinosaurs and humans must now co-exist with one another  and calls out four times  into the sunset.In a post-credits scene  three Pteranodons fly around and ultimately settle down on the Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas.' , 'Life finds a way.'

The boy ran off with super speed to do perimeter duty  leaving her alone with the baby. Frustrated  she ripped off her mask and threw it on the ground. Then Tony saw that she was Violet. Seeing him looking at her  she walked up to him and tried to explain  but he just ran away. He tells Rick that he feels bad about what he did  and he wishes he could just forget ever seeing Violet in her super suit.The Underminer bored back into the ground  setting off an underground explosion that caused bank buildings to collapse into the ground. Drilling through the vaults  he used a tube with vacuum suction to grab cash from the vaults. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) confronts him  and the Underminer turns toward him  sucking him into the tube. He landed in the tunneler\'s storage vault and banged his way out with super strength. The Underminer puts the borer on autopilot  and the two of them fought. Mr. Incredible pushed the Underminer into the borer\'s control panel  smashing it. The Underminer jumped into the vault and escaped  leaving Mr. Incredible to deal with the now out-of-control drill. It burst through the surface into the street. Dash (Huck Milner) saw a dust cloud in the distance and ran toward it  with Violet pushing Jack-Jack in his stroller and running after Dash. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) stretched herself from one building to another  catching up to the careening drill. It slammed into a support column  destroying the monorail track right as a vehicle approached. Suddenly  their friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) glided in and made a track that guided the monorail safely to the ground. The borer was still running down the street  scraping the sides of buildings along the way. The drill hit a car and flung it into the air  and Dash ran up to an old woman and pulled her out of the way just before the car crashed down. Violet caught up to him and handed off Jack-Jack in the stroller. Elastigirl stretched herself out across an overpass  stopping cars from getting on a bridge as the drill destroyed the supports. Mr. Incredible grabbed a fallen streetlamp and threw it into the treads  but it soon snapped. Dash ran up to him and put Jack-Jack in his hands. Violet threw up force fields to protect bystanders from the machine. Mr. Incredible ran past her and handed Jack-Jack back to her. Elastigirl jumped into the open hatch of the borer  with the rest of the family chasing after it. They saw that it was heading straight for City Hall. Elastigirl stretched out through the engine  trying to spill the coolant so it would overheat. Mr. Incredible jumped in and helped her  and they stopped the drill just short of City Hall. Violet and Dash jumped in  and she put a force field around the whole family just before the engine blew. Looking out the hatch  they saw themselves surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.Rick Dicker gives the family a ride  and Violet tells them that Tony had seen her without her mask. Rick brings them to the hotel room where they\'ve been staying since their house had been destroyed. Rick tells them that the Super Relocation Program has been shut down  and he can only let them stay in the hotel for two more weeks  after which they\'ll be on their own. They say goodbye to him  and sit down at the table to eat Chinese takeout. Violet asks them if they\'re going to talk about the day\'s events. Helen tells them that things are different now  with supers being forbidden to do hero work. Violet asks if that means they\'re going to go back to never using their powers. After going back and forth  Helen slams her hand down on the table  ending the conversation. Later that night  after the kids fell asleep  Bob and Helen are sitting at the hotel pool  wondering what they\'re going to do. Helen tells him that one of them will have to get a regular job. Suddenly  Lucius shows up  and he offers to let the family move in with himself and his wife  Honey (Kimberly Adair Clark) after their time in the hotel is up. Then he tells them that during the Underminer attack  a man who represents the business tycoon Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) handed him a business card  and said that Winston wanted to talk to Lucius  Bob and Helen. With no other options  they agree to the meeting.The three of them show up outside a huge building  the headquarters of DevTech. They get security badges and take the elevator to the top floor  and are greeted by Winston. A woman also walks up and Winston introduces her as his sister  Evelyn (Catherine Keener). He tells them he saw what they did with their kids earlier  and they shoot each other a look  realizing he knows their secret identities. He says he used to work for Rick years ago  before the Supers were forced into hiding  and he explains that Rick was a huge fan of them. Rick had a direct phone line installed in the Deavor house  so they could call the Supers any time they needed them. Winston tells them that one night thieves broke into their house  and his father tried to call Gazerbeam and Fironic  but since Supers had been outlawed  neither one of them answered. The thieves found his dad and shot him. A few months later  Winston\'s mom died from heartbreak. He says that if the Supers hadn\'t been in hiding  it never would have happened. Evelyn counters that her dad should\'ve hidden himself at the first sign of trouble  and Winston explains that they\'ve had that argument forever. Since then  Winston and Evelyn built DevTech  a telecommunications company  with the goal of righting some wrongs. Winston and Evelyn explain that the Supers have been in hiding because of the people\'s perception. All they see is the destruction the Supers cause  not the hard decisions they make or the lives they save. To change that  Evelyn shows them that there are cameras in their badges  and says their new super suits will have cameras as well. Winston says they just need to be super  and he\'ll make sure they\'ll all be legal again some day. Enthusiastically  Bob asks what their first assignment will be  but Winston says that Elastigirl should be the first Super that the public sees in action. Bob reluctantly agrees  but Helen is still unsure.\nBack at the hotel  Bob asks Helen why she wouldn\'t want to take the opportunity  and she explains that the children will need her. Dash is struggling with math  and Violet is nervous about her upcoming date with Tony. Jack-Jack  being a baby  will naturally need lots of attention  whether he has powers or not. Neither of them knew that he had used his powers once before  to escape from being kidnapped by Syndrome  since at the time they were on the ground and he was high in the air  beyond their sight. Bob tells her that the choice is to change the world to allow their children to be who they are  or to possibly soon be homeless. She asks if he\'ll be okay watching the kids  and he says he can handle it with no problem. Lying down to sleep  they knew tomorrow they\'d tell Winston that Elastigirl was in.Winston sends a limo to pick up the family and take them to a huge house that he owns  and he says they can stay as long as they need. Later  Elastigirl comes out of the bathroom wearing her new super suit  one that was designed by Alexander Galbaki. Bob teases her that when Edna Mode (Brad Bird) finds out  she won\'t be happy. Helen finds a note from Evelyn saying there\'s something in the garage for her. She goes out and finds a motorcycle that can split into two parts. Bob watches as she takes off down the street. The next morning  Bob fixes breakfast for the kids  and Violet asks him if Helen is breaking the law by doing hero work. Bob is relieved to see the school bus pull up  and sends the kids off.That night  Violet gets ready for her date with Tony. Bob reads Jack-Jack a bedtime story  and the baby falls asleep. Bob then tries to help Dash with his math homework  but Dash tells him they want the problems done a certain way  and then says he\'ll just wait until Helen comes home. The TV turns on  and Bob is surprised to see Jack-Jack sitting on the couch. He takes him back up to his room and reads another story.In the city  Elastigirl is in attendance at the unveiling ceremony of a new hovertrain. The mayor gives a speech as the Deavors watch in a studio through Helen\'s bodycam. The mayor cut the ribbon  and the train got its first group of passengers. It lifts up and suddenly takes off in the wrong direction. Elastigirl jumps on her cycle and takes off after it. Riding through tunnels and on rooftops  she is able to land on top of the train. Before she can plan her next move  the train goes into a tunnel. She ditches the bike and flattens herself on the roof. She reaches the engineer and finds him staring straight ahead. Coming out of the tunnel  Elastigirl makes herself into a parachute and slows the train to a stop. Going back to the engineer  she notices a pulsing light in his cabin. A message appears on a monitor saying  Welcome back  Elastigirl--The Screenslaver Bob keeps trying to get Jack-Jack to stay in his bed  with no luck. Going downstairs  he finds Violet  who never left for her date  and she tells him not to say anything. Bob goes back to the living room and sits Jack-Jack down next to him and falls asleep. On the TV  a movie is playing with a masked robber holding a man at gunpoint. Jack-Jack sees the masked man  and then looks out the window and sees a raccoon rummaging through the trash. He walks up to the window and is able to pass through it with his powers. Grabbing a half-eaten chicken leg away from the raccoon  he throws it back in the garbage can and uses another power to lift the lid with his mind and slam it down on the can. Then laser beams come out of his eyes  just missing the raccoon. Bob wakes up from the commotion and goes outside to grab Jack-Jack. Just then  the baby split into six separate copies of himself. Bob realizes that Jack-Jack has multiple superpowers. Taking Jack-Jack back inside  Bob gets a call from Helen. She asks him how things are going  and he lies and says the kids are just fine. She tells him about saving the runaway train  and he turns on the TV to see news reports about the dramatic rescue. She thanks him for taking care of the kids  and they hang up. Bob puts Dash and Jack-Jack to bed  and then cracks open Dash\'s math book. Later  he wakes up Dash and tells him that he understands the math problems and can help Dash before school starts.Elastigirl is getting ready to be interviewed by a news anchor named Chad Brentley. Chad is interviewing a foreign ambassador as Helen sits in a green room  nervously waiting for her turn. A stage hand comes in and walks her toward the stage. The ambassador sees Helen and greets her enthusiastically. Chad introduces Elastigirl to the audience  and she walks out to the stage. Suddenly  Chad\'s eyes glaze over and he starts talking in a robotic monotone. Following his eyes  Helen notices a blinking light on a screen. She looks away just in time to avoid being hypnotized herself. Chad says that everyone is being controlled by screens. Helen makes her way to the control room  where she finds everyone staring ahead blankly. The robotic voice continues  saying that the screens are being controlled by the Screenslaver. The voice says the Screenslaver will hijack the ambassador\'s aerocade  and Helen runs and smashes a window. Stretching herself out of the building  she climbs on a rooftop and sees three helicopters airborne. Launching herself like a slingshot  she crashes through one of the helicopters\' windows  but the ambassador isn\'t there. She tells the pilot to get her close to another copter  and she makes the jump. Finding the ambassador in the back  she breaks open the door to the cockpit and sees the pilots in a trance. She smashes the screen with the blinking light to bring them back. Just then  the third chopper smashes into them. Struggling to gain control  she asks the pilots if they can swim  then pushes them out so they land in the river below. Then she grabs the ambassador and slings herself into the air  making a parachute to bring the ambassador safely to the ground.The next morning  Bob is getting the kids ready for school. Violet looks awful and tells him that yesterday at school  she asked Tony why he stood her up  and he acted like he didn\'t know her at all. Bob tells her that Rick has had to erase many people\'s memories after they found out his or Helen\'s secret identity. Violet realizes that Rick had erased Tony\'s memory  after Bob told him to. Stomping off  she grabs her super suit and stuffs it in the garbage disposal and turns it on. But since the suit is indestructible  nothing happens to it. Angrily  she grabs it and throws it against the wall  vowing never to be a hero again.Helen is in a limousine  being given a ride back to the DevTech building. There  a group of people cheer for her  making her feel proud  but she knows the Screenslaver is still out there. Inside  Winston hands her a newspaper that has a headline about the ambassador giving a pro-Super speech  and he tells her their plan is working. She tries to be enthusiastic  but she\'s still worried about the Screenslaver. He leads her into a room filled with other superheroes in costume. One of the women introduces herself as Voyd (Sophia Bush)  and demonstrates her power to make portals that can instantly transport people or things anywhere. Other supers come up and introduce themselves as Screech  Brick  Reflux and He-lectric. They all chatted a while  and Helen is proud of the positive effect she\'s had on them. Talking with Evelyn  Helen hits upon a plan to lure the Screenslaver out. Evelyn will make a tracking device  and while Chad interviews Helen remotely  they\'ll track the signal.Bob calls Rick and asks him if he remembers wiping Tony\'s memory  then explains that he went too far  erasing all memory of Violet from his mind. Rick replies that memory wiping isn\'t an exact science. Bob asks Rick for any information he has about Tony  and Rick tells him that Tony\'s parents own a restaurant where he works after school. That night  Bob takes the kids out to dinner. Violet wonders why he\'s taking them across town to one specific restaurant. Sitting down at the table  they\'re greeted by their waiter  Tony. Startled  Violet shoots water out of her nose  and Tony offers her napkins to clean herself up. Bob tries to push Violet into chatting with Tony  but she just gets more embarrassed and angry. She pushes herself away from the table and walks out of the restaurant.At the station  Chad is talking with Helen through a monitor  and she tells him that she\'s at a secure  undisclosed location. She\'s actually on top of the building  on a transmission tower. Chad shows footage from the hovertrain rescue  when the Screenslaver appears on the monitors. Activating her tracker  Helen locates the source of the signal. The Screenslaver rants about how people are controlled by screens because they\'re lazy. Meanwhile  Elastigirl vaults from one building to another  zeroing in on the source. Finally  she arrives at an apartment building. Snaking her arm under the door  she unlocks it and runs in. The Screenslaver appears behind her and pushes her and himself into a giant cage  then zaps her with a taser. He turns on blinking lights to hypnotize her  but she manages to push him out of the cage and slither out herself. They fight around the room  then he runs out the door  activating a timer on the way out. She runs after him  and he activates a fire alarm  causing others to come running out. He slips down an elevator shaft and onto a rooftop  with Helen in pursuit. Suddenly  he leaps off the roof. Helen jumps after him  grabs him and makes a parachute. As the timer hits zero  the building blows up  and she reaches up and grabs the mask off his face. On the ground  he\'s led away in handcuffs by the police  acting confused. Helen thanks Evelyn for setting up the tracker.Back at the house  Dash asks Bob for help with his new math lesson. Watching TV  Bob sees a story about how a car called the Incredible  a car he once owned when he was a public superhero  had been bought by a billionaire at an auction. Thinking the car had been destroyed along with his house  Bob angrily rummages through some boxes and finds the old remote control for the car. Pressing a button  he makes the car start on the screen. Dash snatches the remote and starts pressing buttons. Everyone in the studio takes cover from the seemingly live car. Bob grabs the remote back and powers it down. Suddenly Jack-Jack sneezes and teleports himself into Violet\'s room. She runs down the stairs screaming  as Jack-Jack now has turned into a red monster  chasing after her. Jack-Jack turns back into his normal self  and Dash and Violet realize he has powers  and Bob hadn\'t told them. Violet asks if he told Helen  and he says no. When she asks why  he angrily tells them that he\'s Mr. Incredible  and he\'s trying to hold the house together through everything. Taken aback  Violet says that she\'s going to call Lucius.Lucius comes over  and he sees Jack-Jack suddenly turn invisible. Weary  Bob grabs cookies and holds one up to lure Jack-Jack out. He reappears  grabs the cookie and munches on it. Bob tells Lucius that he can\'t keep giving Jack-Jack cookies  but when he stops  the red monster appears and starts biting Bob\'s arm. Desperate for some relief  Bob takes Jack-Jack and drives up to Edna\'s house. Seeing him looking like he hadn\'t slept in days  she invites him in. He tells her that he needs some alone time  and asks if he can leave Jack-Jack with her. Jack-Jack looks at her face and transforms his own nose to look like hers. Bit by bit  he transforms the rest of his face to match her. Fascinated by his powers  she agrees to take him and quickly shoves Bob out the door. Bob goes back to the house and collapses on the sofa. He apologizes to Violet for having Rick erase Tony\'s memory  then making things worse at the restaurant. He says he\'s just trying to be a good dad  and Violet replies that he\'s not good  he\'s super. She hugs him  before realizing that he fell asleep sitting up.At the Deavors\' house  a party was going with video playing of Elastigirl catching the Screenslaver. Winston announces that Supers will be legal again  and he triumphantly holds up the Screenslaver\'s suit and goggles  saying that Elastigirl is the one who made it all possible. He says they\'ll sign an agreement on his ship  the Everjust  and it will be televised around the world. Helen rewatches the footage of the Screenslaver capture  and she realizes that something isn\'t quite right. She slips away to the control room and watches some of the raw footage. Evelyn comes in behind her with drinks  happy to be away from the crowd. She tells Helen that her brother knows how to handle people  but she herself never knows what they want. Helen asks her what she thinks they want  and she replies that people value ease more than anything. Helen tells her that she thinks catching the Screenslaver was too easy  then she notices that one of the Screenslaver\'s monitors is tuned into her suit camera. Evelyn says that he must have hacked into the closed circuit  but Helen replies that if he was able to do that  he wouldn\'t just have simple locks on his door. She realizes that he himself must have been hypnotized by the goggles he was wearing  and she grabs the goggles to inspect them. With a swift move  Evelyn forces the goggles onto Helen\'s head.Bob wakes up groggy  and realizes he had been sleeping on the couch. Violet took off his shoes and gave him a blanket and pillow. Later  he goes to Edna\'s house and thanks her for watching Jack-Jack. She says that she stayed up all night  working on a suit that will control all of his powers. Putting Jack-Jack into the testing chamber  she shows Bob how Jack-Jack\'s suit can anticipate which of his powers he\'s about to use. When Jack-Jack turns into a flame  the suit activates an extinguisher with blackberry-flavored fire retardant spraying all over him  and he happily licks it up. Relieved at finally having some control  Bob takes Jack-Jack and puts him in the car.As the blinking lights in the goggles go out  Helen wakes from her trance  finding herself strapped to a chair. Trying to move  she lets out a scream of pain. Evelyn comes on the intercom and tells her that the temperature around her is below freezing  and that if she tries to stretch  she\'ll break. Helen realizes that Evelyn is the real Screenslaver  and the person she locked away was an innocent victim. Helen tells Evelyn that she counted on her  and Evelyn asks her why  because she built her a bike? Evelyn says that they didn\'t really know each other. Helen asks about her brother  and Evelyn replies that he\'s weak  depending on the Supers to always save him  just like his father did. Helen asks if she\'s going to kill her  and Evelyn says that she plans to use her instead.Back at the house  the kids see Jack-Jack in his new suit. Bob demonstrates how he can now control the baby  with Jack-Jack using his laser eyes on command. Then Jack-Jack uses his warp power to disappear  and Bob shows them a device to scan for his location. Seeing him in the corner  Dash holds out a cookie  which Jack-Jack reappears to grab and chomp down. The phone rings  and Evelyn tells Bob that Helen is in trouble. She says she doesn\'t want to say what happened on the phone  and it\'s best if he meets her at DevTech  where the ship is docked. Bob immediately calls Lucius and tells him to watch the kids  and to bring his super suit  since things might get weird. Suspicious at Bob\'s sudden leaving  Dash runs and grabs the car\'s remote control  and Violet gets out the super suits and has them all put the suits on. The doorbell rings  and they open it to see the other supers from the party  all being controlled with a pair of goggles.Voyd tells them that they\'re not safe  and the Deavors sent them for protection. Just then  Frozone runs up and stands between them and the kids  telling them they\'re not needed. He tries to shut the door  but they block him. Dash presses a button on the remote  activating the Incredible  which blasts out of its garage and flies toward the house. Frozone blasts the Supers with an ice wall and slams the door. Dash grabs Jack-Jack as the Supers force their way in. Dash tries to run outside  but he keeps finding himself still inside the house  thanks to Voyd\'s portals. As Frozone is fighting Screech  Violet creates a force field around herself and her brothers to shield them from He-lectrix\'s zapping blasts. As Krushauer tries to crush the force field  the Incredible flies in and stops just before them. Dash and Violet get in and escape  but the other Supers grab Frozone and put a pair of goggles on his head.Evelyn takes Bob to see Helen on the ship  and as soon as he walks in  Helen starts punching him in the face. Stunned at first  Bob tries to fight back  but he can\'t bring himself to attack his wife. As she comes at him with more punches and kicks  he grabs her and tries to break her trance. She kisses him  and with surprise  he kisses back. Then she stretches and grabs a pair of goggles from Evelyn and puts them on his head.Evelyn tells Winston that the heroes are on the ship  resting  and he orders the ship to head out. In the Incredible  Dash and Violet take a moment to decide what to do. They realize they have only themselves  the car and Jack-Jack. They get to the DevTech building and see the ship take off. Dash wishes the car could follow the ship  and it drives itself off the dock and into the water. Jetting itself along  the car quickly catches up to the ship. Violet asks how they\'ll get on the ship  and Dash replies that it would be great if the car had ejector seats. A message flashes across the dashboard   Ejector seats activated.  Suddenly they find themselves flying through the air toward the ship. Violet surrounds them with a force field  allowing them to land safely on deck. Just then  Winston activates the ship\'s hydrofoil  causing it to float out of the water. Evelyn has Winston gather the supers in a room for the signing ceremony. Violet sees them go into the room  then comes back to Dash to find that Jack-Jack had gone missing. Using the tracker  they find him going up in an elevator. They go to follow  but are cut off by Voyd  who attacks Violet. She tries to fight back by using force fields  but Voyd keeps opening portals to deflect them. Dash takes off after Jack-Jack  but he realizes Violet isn\'t behind him  so he runs back and speed-punches Voyd before she can put goggles on Violet.The kids find Jack-Jack in a hall and grab him. With the other Supers coming behind  they hide in a vent. Trying to keep Jack-Jack quiet  they give him the tracker to play with. Hearing Jack-Jack coo  Krushauer uses his power to crush the vent. Getting angry  Jack-Jack transforms into a giant baby and bursts out of the vent  knocking out Krushauer and destroying the tracker. Violet uses a cookie to calm Jack-Jack  who grabs it and goes smashing through the walls  heading toward the room where the Supers are gathered. Turning back to his normal size  he teleports through the last wall. Dash and Violet look for another way in. As the signing ceremony goes live  Evelyn takes control of all of the Supers  having them tell the world that they don\'t serve the people anymore  only themselves. They reach toward the camera  and the feed goes dead.Back at the studio  Chad awkwardly tells the audience to stand by as they sort out their technical issues. On the ship  Evelyn watches as Mr. Incredible  Elastigirl and Frozone lock the delegates in the room with the other Supers. They head up to the bridge and quickly disarm a guard  who gets on his radio and exclaims that Supers have taken the ship. Elastigirl turns the steering wheel  guiding the ship on a path toward the city. Mr. Incredible crushes the wheel  rendering the ship unsteerable. Dash and Violet follow Jack-Jack to the bridge  and without hesitation  their parents and Frozone attack them. Violet throws up a force field for protection  and Jack-Jack floats through the air  landing in Elastigirl\'s arms. With her momentarily confused  Jack-Jack reaches up and rips off her goggles. Evelyn orders Mr. Incredible and Frozone to grab her  but she rips off their goggles.The other Supers burst in and attack  and Jack-Jack transforms into a monster. Elastigirl is surprised to see that he has powers. He-lectrix tries to attack Violet  but monster Jack-Jack rips off his goggles. Soon  all the goggles are off and the Supers stop fighting  but the ship is still heading for the city. Evelyn grabs Winston and heads for a jet. Bob tells Helen to go after her  to finish the mission  while they handle the ship. Bob goes for the engine compartment  but is confronted by Krushauer  still wearing a pair of goggles. He tries to crush Bob with the walls  but he quickly jumps out of the way and hurls a piece of debris at Krushauer  knocking off his goggles. Krushauer is free from his trance  but now the room is filled with debris  blocking his entrance to the engine room. Winston is coming out of his camera-induced trance  and he realizes his sister is the Screenslaver. She pulls him into the jet  but he jumps out before she takes off. Running back to the room  he turns off the screen that was keeping everyone hypnotized  and orders them all to the back of the ship. Elastigirl and Voyd go to the deck and see Evelyn taking off. Voyd opens a portal for Elastigirl to use  and she lands on top of the jet. She forces her way in  and Evelyn starts flying wildly  flinging Elastigirl all around the cabin. Elastigirl makes her way to the pilot\'s chair and is about to punch Evelyn  but she puts an oxygen mask on herself and starts climbing rapidly. With the air getting thinner  Elastigirl starts to feel weak.On the ship  Mr. Incredible tells the others that he can\'t stop the ship  and Dash suggests turning it from the outside. Frozone freezes one of the foils  causing it to break and sending the ship back down to the water. Mr. Incredible lowers the anchor  wrapping himself in the chain. He gets plunged into the water  with Dash waiting for him to turn the rudder. As time passes  Dash gets increasingly worried. But then  the ship starts to turn  and Dash presses the button to lift the anchor.On the jet  Evelyn kicks Elastigirl in the face. Spotting a flare gun  Elastigirl fires it at Evelyn\'s oxygen tank  creating an explosion that sends Evelyn flying out the window. Elastigirl puts the jet on autopilot  swings out the window  grabs Evelyn and makes a parachute. Refusing to be saved by a Super  Evelyn kicks herself free and starts falling again  but Elastigirl grabs her again and Voyd opens a portal over the water  depositing them both safely on the ship\'s deck.With the ship turning away from the city  a large wave gets kicked up. Frozone freezes it to create a cushion for the side of the ship to run into. As such  even though the ship runs aground into the city on a sideways trajectory  it is otherwise brought safely to a stop without significant injury or property damage. Helen turns to Bob and asks if she missed Jack-Jack\'s first power  and he says more like the first seventeen. Evelyn is led into a police car in handcuffs  and she tells Helen that saving her life doesn\'t make them right  but Helen is unfazed at her enemy\'s remark. Bob tells Violet that she should try introducing herself to Tony again. Days later  a judge rules that Supers should be made legal again. At school  Violet walks up to Tony and introduces herself. They chat for a while  getting to know each other again.One night  Tony walks out of his door and into a car where the Parr family is sitting. They all head off to a theater together. When they get there  they see a group of police cars chasing down a criminal. Violet gets Tony out of the car  hands him money for tickets and popcorn  and tells him to save her a seat. Confused  Tony does as ordered. Violet gets back in the car  and they all put on their suits and masks. Bob pushes a button  transforming the car into a family sized Incredi-wagon. Bob hits the gas  and the family sets off on another adventure together.' ,  It's been too long  dahlings.   'Back to work.'  'Almost ready.'  'Suit up.' 
218.992339,2018,Mary Poppins Returns,130,131,6.7,4090,20181219,0,0,1,0,0,1,0, 'In 1935 London  Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw) lives in his childhood home with his children Annabel (Pixie Davies)  John (Nathanael Saleh)  and Georgie (Joel Dawson). With his wife  Kate  having died a year ago  Ellen (Julie Walters) (Michael\'s and Jane\'s long-time housekeeper) and Jane (Emily Mortimer) (Michael\'s older sister) are helping him to raise the children. However  Michael has taken a loan from the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to cover expenses  and William Weatherall Wilkins (Colin Firth) (a corrupt president of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank) sends his associates to warn him that his house will be repossessed if the loan is not repaid entirely by Friday. Michael and Jane remember their father left them shares in the same bank that can cover the loan and search the house for the certificate proving their ownership of the shares. During the search  Michael finds a kite  but finds no worth in it anymore and puts it out to give away.While out in the park with Annabel and John  Georgie finds the kite and tries flying it. He ends up being pulled into the sky  but then comes down with Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt)  who decides to take care of the three children as their nanny and starts off by drawing them a bath  which leads down to an oceanic world; however  Mary Poppins denies anything fantastical happened.Michael goes to the bank to see if he can find proof of his shares  but Wilkins denies that there are any records of them before tearing the record out of the official ledger and burning it in the fireplace after Michael has left his office. That evening  Annabel and John decide to sell their mother\'s  priceless  bowl to pay off the debt. Georgie tries to stop them  and the bowl ends up damaged while the three were fighting over it. Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) (a cockney lamplighter) greets Mary Poppins and joins her and the kids on a trip inside the painting on the side of the bowl. The group meets the talking animals drawn on the bowl  and Mary Poppins creates the Royal Doulton Music Hall. However  Georgie is kidnapped by a gang of a wolf  a weasel  and a badger who try to steal the children\'s stuff  and Annabel and John go to rescue him. They successfully do so but end up going out of painting  and later wake up in their beds  thinking their experience was a dream but realizing it was shared and discovering it was true by seeing a fixed wheel in the bowl\'s carriage.The next day  Mary Poppins and the children go to see Mary\'s cousin Topsy (Meryl Streep) (Mary Poppins\'s eccentric Eastern European cousin called Tatiana Antanasia Cositori Topotrepolovsky) to get the bowl fixed and find out the bowl has little monetary value. They then go to the bank to give Michael his briefcase  but when the children go to Wilkins\' office to ask him for help  they overhear him planning to take away their house. Realizing Wilkins and his associates turn out to be also the same animal gang who kidnapped him  Georgie interrupts the banker\'s meeting. When Michael arrives  he does not believe the children and becomes angry with them for putting the house and his job at risk. Mary Poppins takes the children home  and they are guided by Jack and his fellow lamplighters  who teach the children their lingo.Back home  Michael scolds his children for putting his job at risk  telling them that the bank repossessing the house is true  and fears that he will lose his wife\'s spirit too  but the children reassure him that she will always be with them  and Michael forgives them.\nThe Banks family prepares to move out of their house  but while examining his old kite  Michael realizes Georgie used parts of the shares certificate to cover the kite\'s holes.

A gigantic meteorite with the toughest metal: vibranium  crashed in the region of the sources of the Nile river   millions  of years ago and it affected the plants. Later  in the age of humans  five tribes in the land named Wakanda battled for control of that vibranium until a spirit led a certain warrior to find and eat a  heart-shaped herb  affected by the metal. He gained superhuman abilities  and became the first  Black Panther . Four of the five tribes submit to his power but one tribe wants freedom. The Wakandans use the vibranium to develop highly-advanced technology. They see the horrors of the other nations and isolated themselves from the rest of the world. They hid and pretended that they are not industrially developed like a third world country.In Oakland  California  Prince N\'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) vows to share Wakandas technology with people of African descent around the world in order to help them conquer their oppressors. N\'Jobu enlists black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue to infiltrate Wakanda and remove a cache of vibranium.In 1992  King T\'Chaka learns of his brother\'s actions. He confronts N\'Jobu  who becomes angry and threatens to kill T\'Chaka\'s loyal friend  Zuri (Forest Whitaker). T\'Chaka reluctantly kills N\'Jobu to save Zuri  and abandons N\'Jobu\'s son Erik in order to prevent the Wakandan people from learning the truth.In the present day  following T\'Chaka\'s death at the hands of Helmut Zemo  disguised as a masked James Barnes  his son T\'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. After working with Okoye  the leader of the all-female fighting force the Dora Milaje  to extract his ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment in Nigeria\'s Sambisa Forest  he reunites with his mother Queen Ramonda and younger sister Princess Shuri  the nation\'s current technological genius. At his kingship ceremony he is challenged for the crown by M\'Baku  the leader of the fifth tribe  the mountain-dwelling Jabari. The two engage in ritual combat  with T\'Challa emerging victorious and becoming the new King. He let\'s M\'Baku live.In London  a gang led by Klaue and including an ex-U.S. black ops soldier  Erik Stevens a/k/a/  Killmonger   steals an ancient Wakandan vibranium ax from a museum. When the tribal elders receive word that Klaue has resurfaced in South Korea  T\'Challa\'s friend W\'Kabi  who lost his parents as a result of the dealer\'s actions  urges the young monarch to bring him to justice. T\'Challa  Okoye  and Nakia plan to intercept Klaue at an underground casino in Busan  where he will be selling the ax to an unknown buyer. The plan  however  goes wrong when T\'Challa discovers the buyer is CIA agent Everett Ross and Klaue suspects the deal is a setup.The deal subsequently goes sour  and a car chase ensues that culminates in Klaue\'s apprehension. While in CIA custody  however  Klaue is rescued by Killminger. Ross is seriously injured saving Nakia in the attack  and rather than pursue Klaue  T\'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda where his sister Shuri uses the nation\'s advanced technology to save Ross\' life.Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda as a token  revealing his identity as N\'Jobu\'s son to the tribal elders and challenging T\'Challa for the throne. Killmonger triumphs in ritual combat and hurls the defeated T\'Challa over a waterfall. After ingesting the heart-shaped herb to gain the powers of the Black Panther  Killmonger enacts his father\'s plan  preparing shipments of Wakandan weapons to be distributed to Wakandan operatives around the world. Nakia  Shuri  Ross  and T\'Challa\'s mother Ramonda flee to seek the aid of the Jabari and learn M\'Baku\'s men have found and are caring for the comatose T\'Challa.Healed by a heart-shaped herb brought by Nakia  T\'Challa returns to Wakanda and to renew his combat with Killmonger for the throne  which was never officially concluded since T\'Challa never died or conceded. When Killmonger refuses to cooperate  his claim to the throne is immediately invalidated and Okoye and the Dora Milaje turn against him. However  Killmonger who is now wearing a suit of Black Panther armor of his own resists with force along with the Border Tribe. While Shuri  Nakia  and Jabari battle W\'Kabi  Ross  piloting a remote jet with Shuri\'s guidance  shoots down the planes carrying the weapons before they can leave the country. The battle goes poorly for T\'Challa\'s side until M\'Baku and the Jabari arrive to support him  thus turning the tide. T\'Challa and Killmonger\'s battle carries them into the heart of the vibranium mine  where sonic disrupted used in the transport of the metal incapacitate their vibranium armor. While Killmonger\'s body is briefly exposed  T\'Challa stabs his cousin. He takes Killmonger to see the sunset of Wakanda and offers to heal him. But Killmonger states that he knows he will then be imprisoned and would rather die a free man. He pulls the dagger out of his chest and dies peacefully.With that victory  T\'Challa is officially restored to the throne  with M\'Baku granted a seat in the national tribal council to represent his tribe in recognition of his loyalty. Rejecting the isolationism of past Wakandan kings  T\'Challa establishes an embassy in the United States to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene  T\'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda\'s true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene  Shuri continues to help Bucky Barnes with his recuperation.' , 'Long live the king.'  'Hero. Legend. King.'  'A king will rise.'  'The Avengers have a new king.'

Across the known galaxy during the early years of the First Galactic Empire  organized crime syndicates are running rampant due to rampant lawlessness on the mid and outer rim worlds since the fall of the Galactic Republic  forcing others to fight for survival. On the industrial ship-building planet Corellia  Lady Proxima (voice of Linda Hunt)  leader of the White Worms gang  is after a hyperfuel known as coaxium. Meanwhile  one young man seeks a way out of Corellia for good.That man is Han (Alden Ehrenreich). After getting his hands on some coaxium  he meets with his girlfriend Qi\'ra (Emilia Clarke) as they plan to escape. They are found by some of Proxima\'s minions and are taken to her  where she demands the coaxium. Han takes out a rock that he pretends is a thermal detonator and throws it at the walls to bring in sunlight  which Proxima and her species are allergic to. Han and Qi\'ra run and evade the worms as they chase after them  managing to lose them after Han gets them through a tight spot in the wall with a stolen speeder  but they end up stuck and have to continue running on foot.At the nearby spaceport  Han and Qi\'ra evade Imperial storm trooper guards and bring the coaxium to a female Imperial officer as a bribe to help them escape. They nearly make it to freedom until they are spotted by the worms again. Han is able to make it out  but Qi\'ra is captured. Separated by a security gate  Han promises to find a way to get her out. Now on his own  Han decides to enlist as a pilot for the Empire. He speaks to a recruitment officer  and he asks Han his full name. When he can\'t give him a surname  and when the officer sees he is alone and has no family  he dubs him Han  Solo .The story jumps ahead three years...Han is fighting on the muddy  foggy planet Mimban as an Imperial infantryman -- he has since been kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination. Most of the fighters on his side are killed  but Han manages to find three thieves posing as fighters - Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson)  his girlfriend Val (Thandie Newton)  and the alien Rio Durant (voice of Jon Favreau). Fed up with constant conflicts  Han wants to join them after telling them he\'s a good pilot  but Beckett refuses to let him join  even after Han threatens to blackmail them. Beckett sets Han up to be arrested  lying to some Imperial officers. Han is taken by guards and thrown into a pit to be fed to a beast. The beast turns out to be the Wookie Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). He attacks Han  but when Han reveals he can speak the Wookie language  they decide to work together to break out. Han uses Chewie to break the beam that\'s keeping them bound together  collapsing the ceiling and spilling the two guards that threw Han into the pit down to the floor. The two escape and see Beckett  Val  and Rio leaving on a ship  hoping to have caught a ride. Rio manages to convince Beckett to bring the two on-board since the immensely strong Chewie could work well as extra muscle.The crew rests for the night on the snow-covered planet Vandor before their upcoming job. As they sit around a campfire  Val figures that Han has joined them for a girl. Beckett tells Han that they are trying to steal a large amount of coaxium from a train for the people they work for. Beckett disassembles a DL-44 blaster rifle he\'s brought with him  stripping it down into a pistol that he gives to Han.The next day  the crew spots the train and they go in for the heist. They find the coaxium  but they are attacked by a gang of Cloud Riders. The crew fights them off  but Rio is shot as he flies the ship overhead  forcing Han to pilot the ship. Rio then succumbs to his wounds. Val is at the end of the tracks just over a cliff where the Cloud Riders ambush her. To ensure they don\'t get the others or the coaxium  she blows herself up with the tracks  causing the train to plummet to the ground. Han also ends up dropping the coaxium  realizing that the craft isn\'t powerful enough to yank it away from the Cloud Riders. The coaxium explodes  collapsing a big portion of the mountain.Beckett leaves memorials for Rio and Val  and he punches Han in the face for ruining the mission. They were supposed to deliver the coaxium to a criminal named Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany)  leader of the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Without the coaxium  Beckett fears Dryden will kill him. Han offers himself and Chewie to help Beckett find another stash of coaxium and reach a new deal with Dryden. Beckett reluctantly agrees to let Han and Chewie come along.The three travel to Dryden\'s huge  luxurious ship docked nearby. While attending a lavish party  Han spots Qi\'ra  who has been working for Dryden for the last couple of years. After the ruthless Dryden kills the regional governor in his private room  he steps outside to speak to Beckett and meet Han and Chewie. After discussing what happened with the coaxium  Han suggests that they steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. Dryden has Qi\'ra join them. The danger is that unprocessed coaxium is highly unstable and must be taken to a refining facility quickly before it explodes.In order to get a ship to travel to Kessel  Qi\'ra brings the three to meet the charming smuggler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) as he is playing a card game of Sabaac against other alien pilots. Han challenges Lando to a game  where the winner gets the other\'s ship. Han appears to poised to win  until Lando cheats  using a card hidden in his sleeve to outmatch him. Still  Lando joins Han and the others on their mission for the potential profits that would follow. They stop to get Lando\'s droid friend  L3-37 (voice of Phoebe Waller-Bridge)  who is watching a fight between other droids and is upset to see that they are used like gladiatorial slaves. Lando brings them to his ship  the Millennium Falcon  and they take off for the mining planet of Kessel.The team arrives on Kessel and heads toward the mines  having to navigate the large  stormy cloud that surrounds the planet. L3 initiates a riot by freeing captive droids  which allows the others to find the coaxium and take it. At the same time  Chewie spots imprisoned Wookiees  and Han allows him to go and free them. An all-out battle begins as the team tries to escape  only to be shot at by the creatures. L3 is blasted  and Lando runs in to save her  losing her lower half  and he is wounded trying to take her back to the Falcon. The team gets the coaxium on-board and they fly away  where L3 dies in Lando\'s arms. As the team flies out  they are found by an Imperial star destroyer blockade that sends out TIE fighters to attack. With Lando injured  Han must pilot the Falcon to evade the TIE fighters and make it through the Maw  a cluster of black holes. They are attacked by an enormous space monster that tries to devour them. Han must then do a  Kessel Run   but Lando points out nobody can do it in less than 20 parsecs. Using a piece of L3\'s machinery to navigate the ship  they find themselves being sucked toward a black hole  which the space monster falls victim to as it is ripped apart. Han then has Beckett use a small dose of coaxium to boost the Falcon out of danger. It works and they fly out  and Han is able to brag that he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.The team is set to meet with Dryden on the planet Savareen  where they plan to process the coaxium at a disused refinery. The group are soon found by the Cloud Riders. Han tries to bluff them  saying he has a small unit of soldiers waiting aboard the Falcon. The ruse fails when Lando flies off in the Falcon. Beckett believes the Riders are a bunch of marauders  until their leader  a teenage girl named Enfys Nest (Erin Kellyman)  reveals herself and says they only want to keep the coaxium out of Crimson Dawn\'s hands. A resistance is building in opposition to the Galactic Empire and Nest wants the coaxium to use in the fight.Han  Qi\'ra  and Chewie bring the coaxium to Dryden who\'s ship lands nearby. When he sees a sample  he says that it is fake. It turns out Beckett was his inside man  and he told Dryden that Han had been planning to sell the coaxium to the Cloud Riders. However  Han reveals he took a page out of Beckett\'s book and anticipated that Beckett would betray them. The coaxium in the room is real  and the Cloud Riders have nothing. Beckett takes Chewie hostage  along with the coaxium. Dryden fights Han and Qi\'ra  ending with Qi\'ra overpowering Dryden and stabbing him through the heart with his own blade. Qi\'ra tells Han to go after the coaxium and to save Chewie  and she will join them soon.Han catches up to Beckett. Beckett attempts to talk his way out of the situation and draws his gun  but Han shoots first and kills Beckett. Meanwhile  Qi\'ra contacts her true boss... a shadowy figure who reveals himself to be Darth Maul (Ray Park). She tells him of the mission\'s failure  and he assigns her to Dryden\'s former position. She leaves on Dryden\'s ship  passing over Han and Chewie. She looks over to him  and he looks back.Han gives the coaxium to Enfys and her team. She offers him a chance to join them  but he declines. Enfys leaves Han and Chewie with a vial of coaxium for themselves.Han finds Lando and challenges him to another game of Sabaac  only this time  he manages to swipe Lando\'s cheat card from him before the match. Han wins fairly  and he gets the Falcon. Along with Chewie  they decide to head to Tatooine after Beckett had mentioned a gangster (Jabba The Hutt) putting together a crew for another mission. Han then puts the Falcon into hyperspace as they take off.' , 'Never tell him the odds.'

Thor guesses that Thanos would next be after the Reality Stone  which is in the possession of the Collector in Knowhere  but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing Thanos from the dwarven planet of Nidavellir  where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. Thor orders Rocket with him to Nidavellir  while Peter Quill  Gamora  Drax and Mantis travel to Knowhere.

Nebula escapes and signals the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan  Thanos\' home world. Thanos and Gamora travel to the planet of the Soul Stone  Vormir  where the Red Skull  the Stone\'s keeper  informs him that retrieving the Stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves.

While discussing their tactics  Strange uses the Time Stone to view alternate futures  telling them he\'d seen 14 000 605 of them  with only one where the Avengers win.

After several months of rigorous training and exercise  he loses some weight and gets into much better physical shape. He enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.Upon completing basic training  Spencer takes his exams to qualify for para-rescue school. But  owing to having poor depth perception  he is turned down. Upset  he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him  and is soon stationed abroad.

They depart from Amsterdam Centraal station on the 15:17 train to Paris.On the train  all seems well  until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When Moogalian goes to investigate  a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger  Damien A.  grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the assault rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train  trying to escape.Using a pistol  the terrorist shoots the passenger who took his rifle. Eventually  the terrorist approaches the next car  where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him  he springs into action. He decides that his only hope  and the only hope of the remaining passengers  is for him to try to defeat the terrorist.

Migo\'s father  Dorgle (Danny DeVito)  projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head  believing this allows the sun to rise. While learning how to ring the gong  Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper\'s daughter  Meechee (Zendaya)  whom he has a crush on  and misses the gong  landing outside the village. There  Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a  Smallfoot  (human)  whom the yetis have taken for legend. Migo runs back to tell the villagers what he saw but has no proof. The Stonekeeper banishes him from the village for blasphemy.Migo is suddenly visited by Gwangi (LeBron James)  Kolka (Gina Rodriguez)  and Fleem (Ely Henry) who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society (S.E.S.)  which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo to be lowered below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is literally nothing underneath.

The older nun goes through the door to find some kind of artifact  while the younger nun  Sister Victoria (Charlotte Hope) starts to pray. The older nun emerges attacked and bloodied  telling Victoria to run before she is pulled back into the darkness. Victoria runs toward a window as the attacker while clutching a key  the demon nun Valak (Bonnie Aarons)  moves slowly but closer toward her. Victoria asks God for forgiveness before she jumps and hangs herself. Sometime later  her decaying body is discovered by a man simply known as Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet).The officials at the Vatican learn of Victoria\'s suicide  which is considered the ultimate sin. They enlist Father Anthony Burke (Demian Bichir) to investigate. He seeks out a young novitiate named Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga)  who currently acts as a teacher to young girls. The two get together and go to find Frenchie so he can take them to where he found Victoria\'s body.The three go to the abbey where Frenchie leads Burke and Irene to the ice box where he left Victoria\'s body. Frenchie points out that Victoria is sitting up when he left her body lying down. Burke pries Victoria\'s fingers open and finds the key in her hand. They then take her body to give her a proper burial. While walking back toward the abbey  Burke notices fresh blood on the steps where Frenchie found Victoria\'s body. They then go into the chapel but cannot enter the abbey yet. They meet the Abbess (Gabrielle Downey)  who informs them that are engaging in a vow of silence for Victoria  and that they may enter the next day.Burke and Irene go to their rooms while Frenchie leaves. He walks past the dark woods and sees what looks like Victoria walking through the woods. He follows her and ends up attacked by a demon nun. Frenchie picks up a cross from the ground and walks away with it.Irene tells Burke about a series of visions she experienced as a child  all of which ended with her hearing the phrase  Mary points the way . Burke then recalls an incident in France in which he was summoned to exorcise a young boy named Daniel (August Maturo) that had been possessed. Despite Burke\'s efforts  the boy sustained fatal injuries from the exorcism  and Burke has been wracked with guilt ever since.Later that night  Burke is awoken by the sound of music. He goes out into the woods and sees what looks like a demonic version of Daniel. The vision comes to life and pushes Burke into a coffin before an unholy force buries him alive  leaving him with a bell to ring. Irene also wakes up and wanders the chapel before she sees Valak in the mirror trying to attack her. She runs outside and hears Burke ringing the bell. Soon  multiple bells around graves start to ring  but Irene manages to find Burke\'s coffin and she starts to dig him up. Before she can reach him  demon hands start to pull at him  but Irene manages to free him. Inside the coffin  Burke then finds a bunch of books on the occult.The next day  Burke and Irene go to the abbey  but only Irene is allowed to enter. She meets Sister Oana (Ingrid Bisu)  who tells her that the nuns change shifts to pray to keep evil at bay. Oana hears about Irene seeing Valak  and Oana explains the demon\'s origin. When the abbey was built during the Dark Ages  a duke obsessed with the powers of Hell tried to open a rift to summon Valak  but several men found and killed the duke before Valak could fully emerge  keeping him trapped using an artifact (the same one the nuns from before were looking for) containing the blood of Christ. He remained sealed in Hell until bombs from World War II dropped around the abbey and broke the rift open  setting the demon loose. Oana explains that Valak takes the form of a nun to look like the rest of them and prey on their weaknesses. Meanwhile  Burke reads about Valak and learns his name.Frenchie is in a tavern where he hears that one of the patrons had a 12-year-old daughter that committed suicide by hanging after allegedly seeing something horrible. After Frenchie tells the bartender that he went up with Burke and Irene to the abbey  the bartender warns Frenchie that the two of them may be the next victims.Burke once again attempts to enter the abbey  only to encounter the Abbess again to tell him he won\'t find another way in. He tries to ask the Abbess about the key that he found with Victoria  but she tells Burke it\'s too late and that Irene is lost. Her body then appears to go limp. Burke tries to lift her veil to see her  but her demonic body grabs at him until he rips her hand off of him.Irene awakens after seeing another frightening vision of Valak. She wanders outside her room and is once again attacked by the demon nun. Burke hears the noise and tries to save her but he is also attacked until Frenchie shows up with a shotgun. Irene finds the other nuns and starts to pray alongside them as an evil force carves a pentagram into her back. Irene then sees what looks like Oana\'s dead body  but she quickly realizes that Oana and the other nuns were not real  but visions.The three reunite as they realize that Victoria was not trying to commit suicide  but rather sacrifice herself so that Valak could not possess her body and spread terror. They head into the catacombs to find the artifact with Christ\'s blood. Irene realizes that  Mary points the way  is in reference to the statue of Mary that literally points the way to where they may find the artifact. Sure enough  they come across the vial containing the blood after opening its chamber using Victoria\'s key. Soon  Valak reemerges and attacks the trio. He starts to try and possess Irene while Burke is attacked by the demonic Daniel. Irene is briefly possessed  but Frenchie manages to throw some blood on her to free her. Valak unleashes a dark force upon Frenchie  and then tries to drown Irene. He pulls her up and sees that the vial is broken. She spits the blood in Valak\'s face  sending the demon back to Hell and sealing the rift.As the trio leave the abbey  Irene asks Frenchie his real name  and he says it\'s Maurice. We then see an upside down cross burned into the back of Maurice\'s neck.The film concludes with a clip from the first  Conjuring  movie in the present day where Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) is watching Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) give a seminar on their encounter with the possessed Maurice  who later committed suicide. His contact with Lorraine caused her to see visions  and unfortunately for her  it would not be the last time that she encountered Valak.' , 'Witness the Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe'  'Pray For Forgiveness'   She Doesn't Forgive

They are trying to have a child  but their attempts are unsuccessful due to Max's stress surrounding his feelings of inadequacy when compared to his vastly more successful  attractive brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler). During Max and Annie's routine weekend game night with their friends Ryan (Billy Magnussen)  Kevin (Lamorne Morris)  and his wife Michelle (Kylie Bunbury)  Brooks shows up and immediately shows Max up by arriving in a Corvette Stingray and sharing an embarrassing childhood story during charades.Annie also finds Brooks extremely obnoxious and decides to work together with Max to defeat him at the upcoming game night  which Brooks offers to host at a house he's renting while visiting. Max and Annie also try to keep game nights secret from their neighbor Gary (Jesse Plemons)  a humorless and awkward former police officer who stopped being regularly invited when his wife  a former friend of the couple  divorced him.When the guests arrive  including Ryan's new date  Sarah (Sharon Horgan)  Brooks says he's initiated an interactive role-playing mystery game  promising the winner his Stingray. After a while  an actor playing an FBI agent informs them of the narrative of the mystery  only for two masked men to break in and assault him and Brooks. The guests  believing it to be part of the game  idly watch. After Brooks is dragged out of the house  the couples begin to solve the mystery using the clues left behind by the actor. While Kevin and Michelle play the game fairly  Max and Annie track Brooks down using his phone's GPS location  while Ryan and Sarah track down the company in charge of managing the game  hoping to find the answer there.Max and Annie track Brooks down to a seedy bar and  using a pistol left behind by Brooks during the struggle (which they believe to be fake)  they manage to take the keys to the storage closet  where Brooks is being held. After Annie mistakenly fires the gun and shoots Max in the arm  confirming the legitimacy of their danger  the three escape  where Brooks admits that he actually makes his living buying and selling things on the black market  in particular a Faberg?? egg sought by a man known only as the Bulgarian (Michael C. Hall) and is owned by a man using the alias Marlon Freeman.

The group leaves Gary's house and arrives at Anderton's address  where he is hosting an underground fight club. As the others search the house  Ryan spots the egg in a safe on the wall and is caught trying to steal it. The group escapes with the egg  but accidentally break it. They discover the egg is a worthless fake but end up finding a list of names that was stored inside of it  realizing this was what the Bulgarian wanted.The group finds Brooks and his captors on an under-construction bridge and move in to rescue him. Facing execution  Brooks reveals to Max his own insecurities throughout the years as a reason for his life of crime and only wanted to be as successful as Max. Before the group gets killed  they are rescued by Gary  who is shot in the chest. Max and Annie  who have repeatedly rebuffed his requests to join them in game night  try to encourage him to pull through by promising to invite him to every future game night. Gary then reveals that he faked the entire scenario with the two captors  felons who agreed to help in exchange for a shortened parole  trying to trick them into letting him join game night again. He is  however  unaware about the egg or Brooks' involvement in it  and they are immediately attacked by the real Bulgarian  who captures Brooks after he swallows the list  revealed to be people in the witness protection program  to keep it out of his hands. Max and Annie use Brooks' Corvette (Brooks having secretly put the keys into Max's coat pocket to ensure that he won) to drive to the airport and stop the Bulgarian from taking off with Brooks in his jet. They knock the Bulgarian out and tie him up and free Brooks.A few months later  Brooks  under house arrest for his crimes  still manages to sell the list for $3 million (though also earning another $20 000 from each person on the list to let them know they've been tipped off)  and Annie finally becomes pregnant.

Since then  the group\'s main rule of the game is that the last one tagged is  it   until next season. With Hoagie having been the last one tagged in the previous year  he first recruits Bob  the CEO of an insurance company  and then Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry  who has seemingly never been tagged because of his strong athleticism and intelligence. Hoagie tells them that Jerry plans to retire after this year\'s game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby (Annabelle Wallis)  a Wall Street Journal reporter doing a piece on Bob  joins them and decides to write an article on the friends who have been playing tag for 30 yrs. They are also accompanied by Hoagie\'s outgoing wife (Isla Fisher) Anna.Once they arrive at their hometown of Spokane  Washington  they locate Jerry and lure him to the local country club  but they are overwhelmed by Jerry\'s skill. Jerry then introduces his fiance Susan. As the others express disappointment over not being invited to the wedding despite their close relationship  Jerry knew he would almost certainly be tagged or at least targeted during the ceremonies. They agree to not play the game at any wedding-related events in exchange for invitations to the wedding. Despite this  the group makes several attempts to tag Jerry both before and right after wedding-related events.The group sneaks into his house at night but are forced to leave when Jerry sets up a convincing ruse that he is actually in Hoagie\'s bedroom at that exact moment (anticipating that the gang would break into his house to tag him) (Jerry was in his own basement  where he had set up a replica of Hoagie\'s bedroom and had Skyped the group from there). The next morning  Hoagie disguises himself as an elderly woman and ambushes Jerry at the mall but is defeated and humiliated. Then  at a rehearsal dinner at the country club  Jerry invites Cheryl Deakins (Rashida Jones)  Bob and Chilli\'s high school crush  to distract the group  and the attempt to tag Jerry leaves Hoagie  Chilli  and Kevin all caught in painful traps  set by Jerry. During the rehearsal dinner  Susan reveals to the guys that she is pregnant.Defeated  the group try to build a new plan. After finding out Jerry attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings  the group decide to strike his next meeting  which is on his wedding day.

He stays there for hours as the guys besiege the room  until Susan comes by  with the wedding just a few hours away. Susan berates Jerry for risking their wedding for a childish game but suddenly appears to fall faint and have a miscarriage. Jerry comes out to help. Chilli is convinced that it is a ruse  but the situation seems authentic  and Jerry himself also tells them he is not playing around and the two leave.The guys receive texts that the wedding is postponed due to the potential miscarriage. However  a suspicious Anna sees that the bridesmaids all made similar Instagram posts. With one of the bridesmaids having a crush on Bob  and having a private profile  Anna creates a fake profile for Bob in order to bait the bridesmaid for the truth. Once they get access  they see a post from the bridesmaid of Susan in her dress  showing that the wedding is still on schedule. Incensed by the trick  the gang decide to crash the wedding. Upon their arrival  Susan confirms the hoax  including the pregnancy. Angry at Jerry for lying  Hoagie decides to tag Jerry at the end of the ceremony after he and Susan kiss. Hoagie charges at Jerry  but narrowly misses and ends up tackling the pastor to the ground. Hoagie then loses consciousness  which Jerry thinks is a ruse  but Anna confirms that Hoagie\'s condition is serious and calls for an ambulance.Everyone meets up at the hospital where Hoagie tells them the truth: he had lied about Jerry quitting after the season because he wanted to reunite with his friends after he recently discovered a tumor on his liver and has advanced liver cancer; he may not be alive for the following year. Jerry chooses to swallow his pride and allows Hoagie to tag him. The group starts the game again  running around the hospital as they did as children  and change their rules so Anna and Rebecca can play as well.\nBefore the credits roll  a photograph is displayed  showing the real group of ten men that inspired the film  who continue to play to this day.' ,  Based on a True Story.

Dr. Kerry Atkins (Marley Shelton)  the lone surviving crew member  is ordered to retrieve research canisters containing a pathogen by CEO Claire Wyden (Malin ??kerman) . Atkins is able to flee in the escape pod when the station imploded  but it disintegrates upon re-entry  killing her  and leaving a trail of debris across the United States  including the Everglades  where a canister is consumed by an American crocodile  and a forest in Wyoming  where a gray wolf is exposed to the pathogen.Primatologist Davis Okoye (Dwayne Johnson)  a former US Army Special Forces soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit  works at a San Diego wildlife preserve. He befriends a rare albino gorilla named George  whom he saved from poachers. One night  one of the canisters crash-lands in George's habitat and George is exposed to it.George grows considerably larger and more aggressive over time. Davis is contacted by Dr. Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris)  a genetic engineer  who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance CRISPR research as a potential cure for disease but discovered that Energyne planned to use it as a biological weapon. The company fired her and got her sent to prison for attempting to expose them. George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. Davis calms him down  but George is captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)  and is put on an airplane. Meanwhile  Claire and her brother  Brett (Jake Lacy)  send a squad of mercenaries led by Burke (Joe Manganiello) to capture the mutated wolf  Ralph  but they are all killed.Claire  hoping to capture Ralph and use George to kill Kate so they can cover up their plans  uses a massive transmitter atop the Willis Tower to lure the animals  who have been engineered to respond aggressively to a certain sound frequency  to Chicago. George reacts violently to the sound and crashes the plane. Davis  Kate  and Russell manage to parachute from the plane before it crashes. George  who survived the crash  joins Ralph as they make their way to Chicago. Davis and Kate convince Russell to help them steal a military medical helicopter  so they can get ahead of George.By the time they arrive  George and Ralph are attacking the city. The military are overwhelmed when the mutated crocodile  Lizzie  arrives  and causes more casualties. Davis and Kate attempt to steal a serum with the hope that they can turn the mutated animals back to normal. They are able to reach Energyne headquarters at the Willis Tower and steal a handful of serums  but they are spotted by Claire and Brett. Claire reveals that the serum only eliminates the animals' aggressiveness rather than revert them to their normal sizes  and she shoots Davis  though he survives. When George climbs up to the top of the tower and causes chaos  Claire orders Davis to distract him while she attempts to escape with Kate held hostage at gunpoint. During the escape  Kate slips the serum into Claire's handbag and pushes her towards George  who devours her alive  and thus the serum. George and the other animals destroy the transmitter  and consequently  the entire tower topples to the ground  which Davis and Kate survive by hovering in a damaged helicopter over the falling tower.With George returned to his normal personality  Davis stays to help him defeat the other two animals  while Kate flees to prevent the military from dropping a MOAB (Mother of All Bombs) bomb on the city. Russell is able to take a laptop of incriminating evidence from Brett  before Brett is crushed to death by falling rubble from the collapsing building. George and Davis trick Ralph into flying into Lizzie's jaws  which decapitates him  then George pierces Lizzie's eye with an iron bar  killing her. With the threat neutralized  the airstrike is aborted  and George helps in clearing the city of debris.  , 'Big Meets Bigger'

Jonas succeeds in getting some of them on board  including Dr. Heller (Robert Taylor)  but something starts attacking the sub violently. This forces Jonas to make a difficult decision  against Heller\'s protest  to abandon the submarine in order to escape certain death. They escape just in time as the unseen force destroys the submarine and disappears.The story moves ahead five years. At Mana One  an underwater research facility off the coast of China. It is operated by a group of scientists spearheaded by Jack Morris (Rainn Wilson) and Dr. Minway Zhang (Winston Chao)  and run by Zhang\'s daughter Suyin (Bingbing Li)  remote explorer DJ (Page Kennedy)  Jaxx Herd (Ruby Rose) the aforementioned Dr. Haller  Mac (Cliff Curtis)  Lori (Jessica McNamee)  Toshi (Masi Oka)  and  The Wall  (??lafur Darri ??lafsson). They are conducting an experiment near the ocean floor involving bypassing a mysterious hydrogen  using a small submarine piloted by Lori  Tosh  and  The Wall  and exploring what\'s beneath. All seems well at first  but the trio is attacked and stranded by something large and fast  causing them to lose contact with Mana One. They later try getting power back up and running  but are attacked again and Lori is wounded by a screwdriver getting rammed into her stomach. The rest of the crew  after much debate  decide to take Mac\'s advice and call Jonas in to help rescue their stranded friends due to his experience with rescuing people from such a deep  dangerous area of the ocean. However  Heller is against this as he thinks Jonas went crazy from his traumatic experience five years ago and doesn\'t believe Jonas\' claims that something attacked him and the divers he was trying to rescue. The plan goes ahead regardless.Unfortunately  Jonas has clearly seen better days  as he\'s seen in a Taiwanese bar drinking regularly and pissing off local boat owners whom he keeps blowing off repairing their boats. Mac and Dr. Zhang meet with Jonas back in his room. Jonas at first tries to weasel out of the situation by offering the two drinks and preemptively rebuking any offers of money. In the end  however  he agrees to come along and help.Meanwhile  Suyin tries to go down and rescue the trapped crew herself in a mini-sub shortly after Jonas arrives. Jonas takes off after her to help  but not before promising Suyin\'s young daughter Meiying (Shuya Sophia Cai) that he\'ll bring her mom back safe and sound. Suyin quickly finds the stuck sub and preps to tow them back to the surface when a giant squid attacks her. Before it looks like her sub will be damaged  the squid is quickly killed by the culprit of the previous attack: a 75-foot-long prehistoric monster shark called a Megalodon. This shark is the same one Jonas encountered five years back that almost killed him  thus proving his sanity. Jonas briefly lures the shark away with some flairs and has Suyin escape back to the surface. He succeeds in getting Lori and  The Wall  on board his vehicle. However  the shark comes back for another attack  and Toshi sacrifices himself so the others can escape  stuffing a goodbye letter to his wife that he was writing earlier into  The Wall \'s pocket. The shark rams the downed second sub  killing Toshi  while everyone else gets to safety. Heller later apologizes to Jonas for not believing his claims.The situation isn\'t over yet  as the sub\'s destruction has caused a temporary pocket of heat to vent upwards and allow the shark to move to normal ocean waters. While Jonas tries to leave and everyone else talks among themselves  Meiying is playing with an RC ball through the halls but is frightened by the sudden appearance of the shark. The shark tries to bite through the hull but fails and leaves after killing a whale. The group ultimately decides to track and poison the shark to death via a small boat. At first they succeed in tracking it using Jonas to shoot the tracker onto its fin and then reel him back in  just BARELY avoiding getting eaten by the shark. Then Suyin goes down in a plastic tank to poison it while the others lure the shark in with chum. This leads to an intense confrontation where the shark tries to swallow the cage whole with her in it. She succeeds in poisoning the shark  but her mask breaks  and she nearly drowns. Jonas dives in after her  and they almost get eaten by the shark. Fortunately  the poison kicks in and the shark dies. Jonas gets Suyin back aboard  and they resuscitate her back to life.The crew initially celebrates by taking pictures of  The Wall  with the shark\'s corpse before he falls into the water due to a prank from DJ. Jonas  however  notices the shark\'s teeth are smaller than the one from earlier  indicating the Megalodon they killed is smaller and younger than the beast they\'ve been hunting. Suddenly  the other bigger shark from before arrives  swallowing  The Wall  whole and grabbing the other Meg\'s corpse off the boat with its teeth. The boat capsizes and Dr. Zhang is severely injured. The shark comes back around to try and eat Jaxx  but Heller sacrifices himself by attracting the shark to him instead  and he is eaten. The surviving crew escape using motorboats and Morris calls in a support helicopter to shoot at the shark  successfully chasing it away. However  Dr. Zhang dies from his wounds in the boat  but not before tearful last words of pride to his daughter.Later that night  Morris tells the crew that they\'re shutting down Mana One and the authorities in multiple Asian countries have been called to deal with the shark. However  it turns out he\'s lying through his teeth  and he actually called in some minor military support to try and kill the shark on his own using depth charges dropped from the helicopter. He goes out on a boat with some others  and it seems to work at first  only for it to turn out they just blew up and killed a whale instead  luring some nearby regular sharks (and later the Meg  who scares them off) to feast on its corpse. Morris gets knocked off the escaping boat and tries to climb onto the dead whale  only to be eaten whole by the shark.The crew finds out the shark is heading for a nearby popular beach in China and plans to lure the shark away from the beach with whale noise recordings and then torpedo it to hell with the mini-subs. The shark initially attacks a nearby Chinese wedding party on another boat and seemingly eats the bride\'s dog Pippin  before briefly terrorizing the locals at the beach. It stops attacking when it hears the whale noises and takes the bait. This leads into a massive chase between Jonas and the shark  as he leads it to Suyin who hits it with a torpedo  but it does nothing. Even worse  is that Jonas\' torpedo won\'t fire. During the fight  a group of news helicopters trying to film the action stupidly crash into each other and the wreckage crashes onto the team\'s boat  forcing everyone into the water. Suyin goes to help the others  while Jonas  in an attempt to protect everyone  goes head-on with the shark  slicking its underbelly open badly with the sub. He then gets out of the sub once the shark tries mauling it and stabs it through the eye  mortally wounding it. A dozen regular sharks move in to finish it off and eat it alive  ending the threat.With the danger passed  everyone regroups aboard the wedding couple\'s boat  including Pippin the dog  who turned out to have survived. Jonas and Suyin are presumably now a couple  their romance being hinted at throughout earlier in the movie. The movie ends with everyone celebrating their victory  and the oceans are now safe.' , 'The most feared predator in history...is no longer history.'

Terry (Duncan Airlie James) is Lara\'s martial arts club operator.\nRichard was an expert on Himiko. He had recorded tapes which detailed out his research on the mythical figure of Himiko. Himiko was the first Queen of Japan and a powerful sorceress. She ruled her empire through dark magic. She spread death and destruction through the mere touch of her hand. An army of her own generals bound and gagged Himiko and dragged her to an Island in the middle of the Devil\'s Sea. There  she remains entombed beneath the mountains. Richard records that he found a map  that records the exact location of Himiko on the Island.Lara participates in a fox hunt for the prize money of 600 Pounds. She has to hang a punctured paint bucket on her bike and evade a group of  hounds   or other bikers. If she can evade till the paint runs out  she wins.\nWhen Lara is arrested after a bike accident involving a police car  Richard\'s business partner Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas) posts her bail and warns her that if she does not claim her inheritance  her father\'s estate will be sold off. Richard went missing 7 years ago in Japan  and even the Tokyo police stopped looking for him 5 years ago. Yet  Lara refuses to accept that Richard is dead.Lara reluctantly accepts and she arrives at her father\'s company to sign the papers. She gains access to her father\'s office via a key left by him in a puzzle box with the lawyer. There she finds a recorded message from Richard detailing his research into Himiko  the mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to command the power over life and death. All the stories about her end with rivers running red with blood. The bloodshed only ended when her own generals buried her alive in a tomb. Richard identified the Island as Yamatai. She finds an email from Richard to Lu Ren  wiring him $20 000 to hire a boat to Yamatai.\nRichard warns Lara to destroy all of his research but Lara decides not to so she can investigate further.Not yet having received her inheritance  Lara is forced to pawn the jade pendant her father gave her  for a measly sum of 8000 pounds.\nLara travels to Hong Kong where she hires Lu Ren (Daniel Wu)  captain of the ship Endurance  to sail into the Devil\'s Sea to the island of Yamatai (Lara finds the coordinates written in code in Richard\'s diary). Lu Ren says that Richard hired his father\'s boat  and even he was missing ever since he went with Richard.\nOn the way over  Lara studies all of Richard\'s research on where the tomb is located  and the coded doors and traps used to prevent anyone from getting near her. Inside the tomb are trials of Himiko  including the Chasm of Souls  The Faces of Himiko  and her army of 1000 handmaidens.The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She is revived by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins)  the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko\'s tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity that seeks control over the supernatural  to harness and turn Himiko\'s power into weapons. Vogel takes Lara prisoner  claiming that he killed her father and intends to use Richard\'s research (which Lara practically delivered to him by bringing it to the Island) to continue his expedition. Lara escapes with the help of Lu Ren  who also survived the storm and has been put to work with the local fishermen digging for Himiko\'s tomb. She evades capture  and escapes as she goes over a waterfall  but is seriously wounded in the process and passes out from her injuries.Lara regains consciousness after nightfall and is forced to kill a Trinity guard when she is nearly discovered. She follows a mysterious figure wandering the island and discovers that the figure is her father  who has himself been held captive on Yamatai. After convincing him that she is real  Richard treats her injuries and despite his protests  Lara sets off to recover his research from Vogel\'s camp. Richard is livid that Lara didn\'t follow his instructions to destroy his research.\nMeanwhile  using Richard\'s diary  Vogel has found the entrance to Himiko\'s tomb  but is not able to unlock the door.\nLara makes contact with Lu Ren and he  along with the fishermen  stage distractions  allowing Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and recover her father\'s research.\nIn the ensuing chaos  Richard makes his way to Himiko\'s tomb but is captured by Mathias  who persuades Lara to open the tomb  something she has prepared for since she was a child. Lara aligns the dials of the tomb one by one and at that point  the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away  allowing them to enter the tomb which has not been seen for over two thousand years.\nRichard realizes that tomb has not been designed to keep people out  but to trap people from escaping the tomb.The party navigate a series of booby traps and locate Himiko\'s sarcophagus. Two Trinity soldiers attempt to remove her corpse but become infected by Himiko\'s  power   which is actually a disease so potent that mere physical contact triggers immediate bodily disintegration.\nLara concludes that Himiko entombed herself for the protection of her people and she was never dragged in there by her Generals. She sacrificed herself to protect the world.\nVogel shoots the infected soldier  concluding that he cannot remove Himiko\'s body; he instead settles for detaching a finger which he seals in a pouch.\nIn the confusion  Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers  though Vogel escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure  he proposes destroying Himiko\'s tomb to prevent the virus spreading across the world. Lara gives chase to Vogel as Richard sets off a bomb  killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts Vogel and the two fight and she force-feeds him Himiko\'s finger before kicking him down a deep chasm just as the infection takes over. She is rescued by Lu Ren and the fishermen  who then commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.Lara returns to London  where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity\'s front company is actually owned by Croft Holdings. She proceeds to investigate Trinity further among her father\'s files and begins to suspect that Ana Miller is one of their agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance in order to have Lara sign over control of Croft Holdings\' business operations to her when Richard Croft stopped cooperating with Trinity. Having witnessed Trinity\'s ruthlessness firsthand  she prepares for her next adventure to thwart their future plans.' , 'Her legend begins.'

The US know that the attack was sponsored by Al-Qaeda  who has sanctuary in Afghanistan.As news of the devastating terrorist attacks that daybreak  Nelson volunteers to lead 595 into Afghanistan. Bowers initially refuses  but veteran soldier CW5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) (a Chief Warrant Officer 5 and ODA 595\'s assistant team leader)  previously scheduled to retire  persuades Bowers to give Nelson command of 595 again (Hal takes back his retirement papers & Stands up for Nelson  who has never been in combat and has only led the team in training for 2 years)  as well as volunteering himself for the deployment. After leaving their families  595 travels to Uzbekistan on October 7  2001. After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland (William Fichtner)  Commander of 5th Special Forces Group  Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban). Their mission is to help Dostum take over Mazar-I-Sharif and put a serious dent in Taliban\'s ability to prop Al-Qaeda. Mulholland gives Nelson 6 weeks  but Nelson retorts that in 3 weeks the harsh winter will shut down all mountain passes. So  they have just 3 weeks. Mulholland is impressed with Nelson\'s smarts and picks his group from the 6 team options available at his command.Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes)  a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Sean Coffers (Geoff Stults)  member of ODA 595. Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill)  member of ODA 595. Scott Black (Ben O\'Toole)  member of ODA 595. Bill Bennett (Kenny Sheard)  a Sergeant First Class in ODA 595. Fred Falls (Austin Stowell)  a Staff Sergeant in ODA 595. Pat Essex (Austin H??bert)  a Master Sergeant in ODA 595. Charles Jones (Jack Kesy)  member of ODA 595. Kevin Jackson (Kenneth Miller)  member of ODA 595.ODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard an MH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR on 19 October 2001 (The Chinook must fly at 25K ft to avoid missiles that can be fired by Taliban forces from mountains that are as high as 10K ft. There is no oxygen on board and the team can go Hypoxic). They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i Sharif  the country\'s fourth-largest city and a long-time stronghold of the Taliban  where they meet Dostum. Their CIA contact informs them that the Northern Alliance is split into 3 militias who are rivals and don\'t coordinate with each other. If they meet in battle  they will forget the Taliban and fight each other instead. Dostum is an Uzbek and was fighting Russian since he was 16. He is 55 now and is now fighting the Taliban.Six of the 12 members  led by Nelson  leave with Dostum to the mountains (as Dostum had only 6 extra horses)  while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed  The Alamo  under Spencer\'s command.\nDostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city  while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar)  who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law (killing women who encourage their girls to study)  and has murdered several people  including Dostum\'s family.\nAlthough the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson\'s abilities (Nelson and his team are also suspicious of Dostum as the camps he picks for rest are in a GPS and radio dead zone. Nelson fears Dostum might be setting them up to be sold to the Taliban for bounty)  Nelson gradually earns Dostum\'s respect (Nelson gets close to Taliban forces (even face of a firefight) to give exact GPS coordinates to the bombers to drop their loads and cause heavy casualties). In one battle  however  Dostum makes a tactical error (he attacks a heavily fortified Taliban town without US air force support. The bombers were out of fuel and were heading back but Dostum didn\'t bother to check with Nelson before attacking)  costing several casualties. Dostum is not willing to put US army soldiers in harm\'s way as if even one of them dies  the US forces leave  and they lose the war against Taliban.\nMeanwhile Mulholland has doubts about the route Nelson is taking (and also because he can\'t speak to Nelson directly) and decides to introduce a 2nd team to advance on Mazar-I-Sharif.Nelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information  while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson  and the U.S. are not willing to pay the potential price (blood) of the conflict and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to  be a warrior  instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile  and  after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller (Michael Pe??a) (ODA 595\'s intelligence Sergeant First Class) to strike a Taliban supply route and being joined by Hal Spencer\'s half of ODA 595  continue to work together. Hal has a slipped disc but continues to carry his own weight.\nThey win several victories with Dostum\'s leadership and manpower and American air-power  making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. When Nelson informs Dostum that another ODA  555  has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad  another Northern Alliance leader  who is Dostum\'s political rival  Dostum is furious  and his men promptly abandon 595.Following Dostum\'s departure  Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles  ODA 595  re-joined by Diller and his element  uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor  but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber  and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces.\nCarrying out the U.S. Army\'s first cavalry charge of the 21st century  the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and Al-Qaeda  and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is med-evacuated  Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations  Dostum and Muhammad meet peacefully and put aside their differences. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans\' efforts  Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter  at the same time bidding him remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Spencer ultimately survives  and all 12 soldiers of ODA 595 return home after 23 days of almost continuous fighting in Afghanistan.The film\'s penultimate moment shows a photo of the Horse Soldier Statue at the World Trade Center in New York City  based on the soldiers of ODA 595 and their victory in the early stages of the response to the September 11th attacks  dedicated to all United States Special Forces.

MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) oversees Grindelwald as he is being transferred to London with one of her employees  Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie). As they become airborne in a carriage pulled by Thestrals  it becomes apparent that Grindelwald and Abernathy have switched places  as Abernathy has always been loyal to Grindelwald. Abernathy fills the carriage with water while Grindelwald diverts the Thestrals' path. They kill two guards  while a third  Spielman (Wolf Roth)  survives his fall. Grindelwald then proceeds to head out and find the rest of his followers.LondonNewt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is being prepped for a hearing with the British Ministry of Magic. He meets with an old Hogwarts' friend  Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz)  who is engaged to Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner)  with whom Newt has a bit of a strained relationship. Newt enters the meeting to have his right to travel reinstated after the events that took place in New York when Newt's beasts were loose and the Obscurial Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) wreaked havoc. Although Newt believed Credence to be dead  he is told that Credence is alive and has resurfaced in Paris. Newt is given a chance to get his travel rights back under the condition that he works under Theseus at the Ministry to help find Credence since they know that Grindelwald is trying to find him and lure him to his side  but Newt refuses to work with his brother. An Auror named Grimmson (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson) takes on the task  though he appears to have sinister intentions.Grindelwald and his followers meet in a private residence to discuss going off to find Credence. In another room next to them  they find a male toddler who can't yet comprehend what is going on. Grindelwald has one of his followers  Carrow (Maja Bloom)  use the Killing Curse on him.Newt leaves the Minstry building and finds a glove tapping him and pointing at him to meet on top of a building. He grabs the glove and is apparated to meet with his former professor  the great Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). They meet privately as Dumbledore also tasks Newt with going off to find Credence in Paris since he may be in danger or be a danger to others. He also leaves Newt with a card with an address for a safe house in Paris. Newt is reluctant to take on this mission  but Dumbledore informs him that it must be him since Dumbledore cannot move against Grindelwald.Newt returns home to his assistant Bunty (Victoria Yeates)  who has scrapes on her arm after handling his Kelpie (like a giant magic seahorse). After dealing with baby Nifflers and the Kelpie  he hears a noise coming from his room. To Newt's surprise  he finds Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) in his room  having apparated all the way from New York. Newt is surprised that Jacob remembers him despite being Obliviated  but Jacob explains that Queenie filled him in on the bad things. Newt is also disappointed to hear that Tina (Katherine Waterston) is not there and has been seeing another Auror after a mistake in a magazine led her to believe that Newt was engaged to Leta instead of Theseus. Newt quickly discovers that Queenie has enchanted Jacob to make him love her  and she reluctantly allows Newt to remove the enchantment. Although a bit displeased at being bewitched  Jacob follows Queenie as she leaves Newt's place to tell her she didn't need to use magic on him because he already loved her. However  they get into an argument due to the laws against magical folk being in relationships with muggles/no-majes. Queenie reads Jacob's mind and hears him call her crazy  so she leaves him. He returns to Newt's place and joins him as they head to Paris.In Paris  we find Credence working at a freak show under the cruel ringmaster Skender (Olafur Dari Olafsson). Credence is close to Nagini (Claudia Kim)  a young woman who is a Maledictus  meaning she is cursed to transform into a snake until one day when the transformation becomes permanent (she will later become Voldemort's pet snake). Skender puts on a show for people to have Nagini shapeshift for them  with Tina in attendance. Credence lets loose a bunch of small creatures that create sparks  leading to chaos in the tent. This allows Credence to get away with Nagini while Tina tries to contain the situation. Skender just takes everything with him and gets out. As Tina walks away  she is found by Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam)  who was also in attendance at the show. He talks to Tina and tells her that he is looking for Credence. Yusuf tells Tina he is the last of a pure-blood line  as is Credence.Grindelwald knows where Credence is headed  to find his birth mother. He plans to use the boy in eliminating Dumbledore.Newt and Jacob take a Portkey to Paris since it's the only way Newt can travel out of the country discreetly. Once they get there  Newt uses a spell to detect Tina's last movements in the area so that he can trace her location  as well as Yusuf's. Meanwhile  Queenie is also in Paris to find Tina. She goes to the French Ministry of Magic for a lead  but gets no help. At the same time  Abernathy and another Grindelwald follower  Rosier (Poppy Corby-Tuech) are lurking in the same building. Queenie is outside the building and overhears Newt and Jacob walking by her. She attempts to follow them but is overwhelmed when she starts to hear everyone's thoughts. Queenie is then found by Rosier  who invites her to join her.Credence and Nagini arrive at the home of Irma Dugard (Danielle Hugues)  the woman Credence was led to believe is his mother. She turns out to only be the nurse who delivered Credence and wrote her name on the documents. Irma embraces Credence moments before they are found by Grimmson. He fires a blast that kills Irma. Credence becomes enraged and takes on his Obscurial form  attempting to attack Grimmson  but he shields himself from Credence's moves  though Credence still manages to destroy most of the house. Credence and Nagini get away  and Grimmson goes to report on what he saw to Grindelwald.Newt and Jacob find Yusuf on the streets. They approach him and ask if he has seen Tina. Yusuf guides the two to a cell where he has imprisoned Tina  and does so with Newt and Jacob as well. Outside  a Zouwu (a large cat-like creature) is on the loose. The three manage to free themselves and subdue Yusuf so that Newt can go out and lure the Zouwu with a toy and keep him in his briefcase with the other fantastic beasts.At Hogwarts  Dumbledore's Defense Against The Dark Arts class is interrupted by Torquil Travers (Derek Riddell) from the British Ministry. Dumbledore sends his students out with Professor McGonnagall (Fiona Glascott). Travers tasks Dumbledore with taking down Grindelwald. He knows that the two of them were once close like brothers  though Dumbledore states they were closer than that. When Dumbledore says he cannot fight Grindelwald  Travers tells him he can no longer teach DATDA. Dumbledore later finds the Mirror of Erised and sees himself and Grindelwald as younger men making an Unbreakable Vow.We catch up with Leta and see a flashback from her days at Hogwarts (here played by Thea Lamb) where she was bullied by other students  so she in turn curses them in ways such as making a girl's mouth disappear. She and Newt (here played by Joshua Shea) were each other's only friends  and he would take the blame for her wrongdoings. While in Dumbledore's DATDA class  the students are handling a Boggart (the being that shows people what they fear most). It turns into a desk for Newt since his worst fear is working in an office  but for Leta  it turns into a white sheet holding something inside. Afterwards  Newt shows Leta a tree where he finds Bowtruckles that have come to trust him. Back in the present  Dumbledore finds Leta. She asks him if he considered her as bad as the others did. He says no  and she replies that he is the only one who didn't see her as such.Rosier brings Queenie to the hideout where she comes face-to-face with Grindelwald. Although Queenie is prepared to defend herself against him  he calmly speaks to her and entices her when bringing up the matter of loving who she wants to love.Newt  Tina  and Jacob take an unconscious Yusuf back to his place. Tina wants to question Yusuf since he might know the truth about Credence. They look into his eyes and see a parasite in there. Newt and Tina manage to pull it out. Tina plans to take back her information to the Ministry  appearing to still be agitated with Newt over not telling her about him and Leta. Newt explains the confusion from what she read. Just then  they look up at the sky and see what look like black drapes sweeping across the sky  indicating that Grindelwald is summoning his followers. Newt and Tina plan to go to the French Ministry to find a box that contains the truth about Credence  while Grindelwald finds Credence and Nagini to try and lure them to his side.Jacob is left alone in the house where he meets the famed alchemist Nicolas Flamel (Brontis Jodorowsky). He shows Jacob a crystal ball where he sees the whereabouts of Credence and Queenie. Flamel tells Jacob that Queenie is going to be at a cemetery in Paris. As Jacob is heading out to leave  he notices that Yusuf is gone. Flamel then goes into his closet (where he just so happens to be keeping the Sorcerer's Stone) and takes out a book to talk to a woman named Eulalie Hicks (Jessica Williams)  as he knows that Grindelwald is rallying his followers at the cemetery  and he fears there will be death.Newt uses Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Theseus to get inside the Ministry. They enter the records room and also take a moment to almost express their mutual feelings for one another. Theseus spots Newt and goes after him and Tina. As they hide  they overhear Leta reading a note saying that Lestrange family records have been moved to their family tomb. Leta finds Newt and Tina  and the records keeper finds them and sics her Matagots (creepy panther-like beasts) after Leta tries to defend herself against them. Newt brings the Zouwu out and it helps them escape.Newt  Tina  and Leta come across Credence  Nagini  and Yusuf. Yusuf reveals that he has been looking for Credence because he wants to kill him  as Yusuf's mother Laurena (Isaura Barbe-Brown) was taken against her will by Corvus Lestrange Sr (Keith Chanter) under the Imperius curse  who impregnated her with a child before she ultimately died. That child was Leta. Corvus Sr remarried and had another child  Corvus Jr  Leta's half-brother  whom Yusuf believes Credence to be. However  Leta says that Corvus Jr is dead because she was the one who killed him. As a child  she was on a boat with Irma  and the baby Corvus would not stop crying. Leta switched him with a quiet  sleeping baby just before the ship started to sink. Leta was on one lifeboat with the other baby  while Corvus was on a different lifeboat that capsized  and he drowned as a result (this is the form that the Boggart took for Leta). Leta has lived with this guilt ever since.As part of his plan  everyone heads to the cemetery where Grindelwald has gathered his followers and set up for Credence to go to him. Jacob finds Queenie  who invites him to join and watch what Grindelwald has to say. The dark wizard preaches about their supremacy over non-magic folks. He shows them future images of World War II to show just how flawed the non-magic community is and how they will only bring their own world into ruins. Theseus leads Ministry Aurors there to stop them  along with Newt  Tina  Yusuf  Leta  Flamel  and Travers. Grindelwald's followers get away just as he creates a Protego Diabolica spell that spreads a powerful blue flame with a dragon-like form to spread across Paris. Several wizards are killed in the fire as the Aurors attempt to stop it. Grindelwald calls for new followers to join him. Credence decides to join  despite Nagini trying to pull him away. Queenie does so as well  even trying to get Jacob to go with her  but he cannot bring himself to do so and watches as Queenie leaves with him. Leta appears to try and join Grindelwald  but she instead makes an attempt to kill him. Grindelwald ends up burning her to ashes  to the horror of Newt and Theseus. Grindelwald disapparates with Credence and Queenie. The Aurors then manage to stop the fire from spreading. Newt then embraces Theseus as they mourn Leta.Newt takes a vial of blood that his Niffler nicked off of Grindelwald and brings it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. This blood pact is the reason that Dumbledore cannot fight Grindelwald  as this is their Unbreakable Vow. Dumbledore tells Newt that he may be able to destroy it.Grindelwald brings Credence and Queenie to a new hideout. He tells Credence his true name: Aurelius Dumbledore  making him Albus' brother. Grindelwald tells Credence that only he can destroy Dumbledore. Credence then tests out the strength of his power by blasting the side of a mountain.  , 'The fate of one will change the future of all.'  'Who will change the future?'

To escape their desolation  people engage in the virtual reality world of the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation)  where they can engage in numerous activities for work  education  and entertainment. Users have discovered Anorak\'s Quest inside OASIS  a game programmed by the late OASIS creator  James Halliday (Mark Rylance). The first to find the Easter egg  locked behind a gate requiring three keys within Anorak\'s Quest is promised full ownership of OASIS among other gifts. This has attracted a number of Gunters ( egg hunters ) to play the game. Innovative Online Industries (IOI)  a video game conglomerate and manufacturer of most of the virtual reality equipment used to access the OASIS  also wants ownership. The new CEO of the company  Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn)  has amassed an army of debt-indentured players  known as  Sixers  (due to their six-digit identification)  to seek the prize. However  to date  no one has managed to finish the first quest  a vehicle race across an ever-shifting version of New York City.Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan)  an orphaned  20-year-old Gunter  lives in a Columbus  Ohio  slum with his aunt. In the OASIS  Wade goes by his avatar Parzival  and has partnered with Aech  a male avatar that serves as a virtual mechanic. He later befriends well-known player Art3mis after saving her from dying in-game - referred to as being  zeroed out  - which would reset her avatar\'s character progression and remove all her goods. Wade decides to study the virtual OASIS library to learn about Halliday\'s personal life  hoping to find a hint to finish the race. Wade learns that Halliday felt regret when he had to accept the resignation of his partner  Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg)  over a personal falling-out  musing   Why can\'t we go backwards for once? Backwards really fast  as fast as we can - really put the pedal to the metal.  At the next race  Wade reverses from the start line  finding a hidden  safe path to the finish line of the race. He gains the first key and a clue to the next quest. Aech and Art3mis  as well as players Daito and Sho  follow Wade to finish the quest  and the five appear atop the global scoreboards  becoming known as the  High Five .IOI takes interest in them  desiring to learn their real-life identities. Bounty hunter i-R0k (T.J. Miller) overhears Wade tell Art3mis his real name  disclosing it to Sorrento  who approaches Wade in an attempt to convince him to join IOI to solve Anorak\'s Quest  but Wade refuses. In retaliation  Sorrento has his assistant F\'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen) attack Wade\'s slum  killing Wade\'s aunt and her boyfriend. Wade is rescued by Art3mis\' real-life friends and is taken to a Gunter hideout in Columbus  where he meets Art3mis\' player  Samantha Cook (Olivia Cooke). The two discover that Halliday had once dated Kira (Perdita Weeks)  who later became Morrow\'s wife  and was the source of their falling-out. In the virtual OASIS archives  Wade wins a bet with its Curator regarding whether Kira\'s memory remains anywhere within the archives  winning a 25-cent coin and access to Halliday\'s memories of Kira  which turn out to be the entrance to the second quest. In a re-creation of The Shining  the High Five team each gain the second key and the clue that the last quest is in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom.Zandor discovers the Gunter hideout and kidnaps Samantha. Meanwhile  Wade is rescued by the real-life players of Aech (Lena Waithe)  Daito and Sho (Philip Zhao)  who have taken to hiding in Aech\'s van. In the OASIS  they learn that IOI has erected a force field blocking access to the castle  maintained by the Sixers  including an enslaved Samantha. Wade hacks into IOI signals into OASIS & hacks Sorrento\'s personal account & blackmails Sorrento into revealing Samantha\'s location and communication access code to free her  and sends a message to all OASIS players about IOI\'s activities  convincing millions to join their side. With Aech  Daito  and Sho leading the players  Samantha is able to shut down the field  by accessing the real world IOI war room as a Sixer and allowing Wade inside. Wade finds that several Sixers have found the Atari room  trying to determine which Atari 2600 game was Halliday\'s favorite; choosing the wrong one leads to being zeroed out after precisely one minute. Sorrento and Wade recognize the right game as Adventure  but successfully completing it causes the playing Sixer to be zeroed out.Sorrento activates the Cataclyst  after a confrontation with Wade and Sho which zeroes out all players on Planet Doom. However  the Curator\'s coin is revealed to be an extra life  protecting Wade\'s avatar. Continuing the quest  Wade deduces that the goal is not to win Adventure but to find its own Easter egg. Upon doing so  he is given the last key. Wade uses the keys to open a gate in the castle  where he is congratulated and presented with a contract by Anorak. Recognizing it as the one Morrow had to sign on his termination  Wade declines. Anorak transforms into a projection of Halliday  who reveals that this was a final test  which centered around his biggest regret in his life. Halliday offers Wade the opportunity to wipe out the OASIS with the Big Red Button if he considers it for the best  and otherwise awards him with the Golden Egg  granting Wade control of OASIS.Sorrento and Zandor are arrested  and IOI\'s indentured servitude division removed  heavily restructuring the company. Wade shares control of OASIS with the other members of the High Five. Morrow offers to help consult on a salary of 25 cents  while revealing he had been the OASIS\' Curator all along. The High Five decide to have OASIS shut down twice a week  to coax people into spending more time in experiencing and fixing problems in the real world  while Wade and Samantha form a romantic relationship and move in together' , 'A better reality awaits.'

There is a city floating above the earth in the sky  called Zalem  suspended by advanced engineering. Beneath this is a city called Iron City. There is a tube from Iron City\'s Factory connected to Zalem. In the junkyard  Dr. Dyson Ido discovers a core of female cyborg that has brain and core heart  but without body nor limbs. Together with a nurse assistant  Ido rebuilds the cyborg with a spare robotic body in his cyborg clinic. She wakes up with no recollection of any memories. Ido names her  Alita   as she didn\'t know her own name. He finds out that the new cyborg body integrates well with Alita\'s original brain as she can control her fingers. Her sensory taste is also proven working when she likes orange fruit when she tried it for the first time.It turns out  the name of Ido\'s deceased daughter was Alita was (referred to as real Alita on-wards). The robotic body was initially built for Ido\'s late daughter  real Alita because she was wheelchair bound. Real Alita never had a chance to use it as she was killed by a cyber-robber  who broke into Ido\'s clinic looking for drugs. Ido\'s partner was Chiren  who is also real Alita\'s mother. Ido and Chiren separated after the real Alita died. Chiren and Ido came from Zalem and was outcasted to come to Iron City. Chiren\'s goal after the death of her daughter is to go back to Zalem. Chiren worked for Vector  as he promises to send her back to Zalem. Vector is the boss who manages Iron City Motorball competition. He has the authority from Zalem scientist Nova to send people to Zalem. The winner of Motorball competition gets to be sent up to Zalem by Vector.Alita befriends a boy named Hugo  who dreams of moving to the sky city of Zalem as well. He also shows her that he wanted to be a Hunter-Warrior like Zapan  a bounty-hunter warrior  with a long sword as his trademark weapon. Hunter-Warrior collects money by killing criminals in Iron City. Hugo also introduces Alita to Motorball race in the neighborhood. Alita tries to participate  falls down and is made fun in the beginning. After a few times  her natural competitive streak shows up  and she is able to defeat everyone to score a Motorball goal.Alita discovers that Ido is a Hunter-Warrior when she follows him one night and they encounter three deadly cyborgs. When Ido is injured  Alita tried to protect him  and finds out that she is naturally skilled in an ancient martial art called  Panzer Kunst.  While in combat  Alita has memory flashbacks of her earlier life on Mars. She used to be a warrior with code \'99\'. With her skill  she kills two of the cyborgs and severely damaging the third one  called Grewishka  who retreats underground. Grewishka promises to come back and hunt down Alita. Despite Alita\'s fighting skills  Ido discourages her from becoming a Hunter-Warrior.Once Vector and Chiren find out Alita\'s capability  they get an order from Nova to kill Alita. Nova promises Chiren that she can go back to Zalem if she succeeds the mission. It turns out  Grewishka works for Vector and Chiren. Vector orders Hugo and his friends to attack cyborgs and steal their body parts for fixing and upgrading Grewishka. Vector promises to send Hugo to Zalem once he gets enough credits doing his dirty work (important later).\nOn the next day  Hugo and his friends brought Alita to a forest area outside the city. Here  they found an old abandoned spaceship from  the Fall  era. Alita went into the spacecraft through an underwater door and brought back a Berserker warrior cyborg body with her. Ido refuses to install her in the body  as he wants Alita to have a second chance in life without being a warrior. Alita is disappointed and rebels by registering herself as a Hunter-Warrior.Alita and Hugo go to the Kansas Bar to ask other Hunter-Warriors to help her take down Grewishka. They refuse to help as Grewishka is not in the wanted list  and there is no benefit / bounty in killing him. Zapan tries to intimidate and embarrass Alita  but Alita easily beat him in a fight and being humiliated in the process. Afterward  Alita challenges all the other Hunter-Warriors and creates a massive battle in the bar. Ido comes in time to stop the fight  as an upgraded Grewishka storms into the bar and challenges Alita to a rematch. Despite her courage and martial arts skills  Alita\'s body is sliced up by Grewishka\'s bladed fingers before Ido and another Hunter-Warrior force him to retreat again. Without any other options  Ido places Alita in the Berserker body  which automatically integrates with her.Vector realizes that he is not able to defeat Alita easily. He arranges for a Motorball match where all the participants are instructed to kill Alita for a significant amount of credit. At the same time  he urges Hugo to enter Alita in the Motorball competition. When Alita wins  both Hugo and Alita can go to Zalem.With her new body  Alita has higher power and enhanced flexibility. She enters her name in a Motorball tryout race  as per Hugo\'s request. Ido discovers that the other contestants are Hunter-Warriors and other cyborgs hired by Vector to kill her. Meanwhile  Zapan is plotting his revenge against Hugo and Alita. Zapan caught Hugo and his friend Tanji while they are stealing cyborg parts. Zapan kills Tanji and frames Hugo for murdering the cyborg they were taking parts from.Now Hugo has a bounty on his head  and all Hunter-Warriors are looking for him. While Alita is in Motorball race  Hugo is trying to escape from Zapan. Hugo calls Alita and tells her to meet him at the abandoned church. After Alita eliminates the other contestants  she heads to the church to confront Zapan and learn the truth about Hugo\'s work before Zapan mortally wounds him. Chiren was at the church  supposed to kill Alita  but instead  she saves Hugo\'s life by having him decapitated and uses Alita\'s heart to keep his brain alive. This angers Zapan  but Alita grabs his Damascus Blade sword and slices off his face.Hugo\'s head is transplanted onto a cyborg body by Ido. He also tells Alita that Hugo\'s belief of going to Zalem for one million credits was a lie fabricated by Vector  as citizens of Iron City will never be able to enter Zalem. Alita storms through the Factory to confront Vector. Vector reveals that Chiren has been murdered and her organs and body parts will be sent to Zalem. This is the only way citizens of Iron City gets to go to Zalem.Alita once again battles Grewishka in Vector\'s office and kills him before stabbing Vector  who has been mentally controlled by Zalem scientist Nova. Alita promises Nova to get revenge for Hugo  and he made the mistake of underestimating her. In the meantime  Hugo has run away from the clinic. With his new cyborg body  he attempts to climb a Factory tube towards Zalem. Alita pleads with Hugo to return with her  as a massive spiked ring sent by Nova comes hurtling down the tube  shredding Hugo\'s body. Alita manages to grab Hugo\'s remaining arm and use her sword to secure hold onto the tube. Hugo\'s elbow joints cannot support him and break apart  but not before he can say goodbye  leaving Alita on the tube clutching the remaining of his arm. Alita is devastated but determined to live on Hugo\'s memory.In the final scene  Alita is shown as the star athlete of the Motorball tournament.

Word of this gets back to his basketball coach  who had promised him a starting position on the team. He warns John that if he gets a failing grade  that he will be benched. John later returns and gives a half-hearted presentation  saying that everyone pretty much already knows he's adopted and doesn't know much about his true background.Not long after this  John and his two friends Josh and Reiger (the latter goes by his last name because his first name is also Josh)  head onto an iced-over lake near their neighborhood. A nearby resident tells them to get off the ice because it's not safe  but they refuse. The resident leaves to call the police and a short time later  all three fall through a weak spot on the ice. Rescue teams soon arrive and the two Joshes manage to swim to the surface and are rescued. Two first responders get into the hole to try and find John. As they're about to give up  one of the rescuers  Tommy Shine (Colter)  hears a voice telling him to go back. Thinking it's his chief  he tries again  and manages to lift John to the surface.With no pulse or breath  John is taken to the local hospital  where a team of medical professionals work frantically to save his life. After John still fails to register a pulse  the attendant physician  Dr. Sutterer  gives Joyce a chance to say goodbye. A weeping Joyce enters the trauma room and cradles her son in her arms. After a moment  a faint pulse begins to register. With renewed hope  Dr. Sutterer recommends transferring John to another hospital better equipped to save his life  citing Dr. Garrett (Haysbert) as an expert in cases like John's.After John is transferred and put in a medically-induced coma  Garrett warns Joyce and Brian that he has little hope for John's recovery  citing that if John were to pull through  he would most likely be in a persistent vegetative state for the rest of his life.Throughout all this is a subplot involving Joyce and Jason Noble (Grace)  the new liberal pastor at the family's church  with whom Joyce frequently clashes. Joyce slowly warms to Noble after he shows up at the hospital upon learning of John's accident. Like Joyce  he regards John's progress as divine intervention.Later  John shows some signs of consciousness  as his ability to hear Joyce and Pastor Jason  responding with squeezes to the hand  and a tear trickling from his eye as a crowd gathers outside his hospital window to sing and pray for his recovery.Joyce turns John's possible recovery into an obsession  constantly harassing the health care professionals into making John their only priority  alienating those around her  including her own husband. During a heated moment  Joyce tells Brian that if it wasn't for her  John would be dead  completely forgetting her Christianity which had long been the foundation of her character. After a brief and hurtful rebuttal  Brian storms off.Coming to the realization that she can't control John's outcome  Joyce retreats to the roof of the hospital to pray  asking God for forgiveness and submitting to His will. As she concludes her prayer  it begins to snow  which she believes is an answer. She and Brian meet again with Garrett  who tells them that the drugs they have been administering to John during his medical induced coma are becoming toxic to his system and may be doing more harm than good. Joyce  who had previously been adamant about saving John's life at all costs  suggests stopping treatment and bringing him out of the coma  stating that she's ready for whatever fate brings. Garrett agrees.Garrett administers the drug to bring John from the coma. His body begins to convulse and he slowly begins to regain consciousness  where he re-lives the accident where he fell into the water. He hears his mother's voice and opens his eyes  with full cognitive ability. A few days later  he is discharged from the hospital and returns to school.However  John's return  while welcomed by many  is met with some resentment by others  who question why John was spared while their own loved ones had died. This weighs heavy on John's mind and he returns to the lake in search of a possible answer. He sees Tommy Shine sitting on a bench looking out over the lake and thanks him for saving his life. Tommy counters by admitting that he did not believe in God until after a series of protracted events since John's accident and that all Tommy did was pull him from the water.John reconciles his survival with a renewed sense of purpose in his life and rebuilds his relationships with those he had been alienating earlier. The movie ends with an epilogue that John is pursuing a career in ministry after graduation from high school.  , 'Based on the impossible true story.'

Shortly after  she meets Charles Xavier  who brings her to the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters at the X-Mansion.In the present day of 1992  eight years after the attacks on Earth by Apocalypse  the X-Men are now seen as heroes across the world  adored as superheroes. After the space shuttle Endeavor is critically damaged by a supposed solar flare during an STS-49 mission  the President of the United States requests Professor X and the X-Men to save the astronauts. While the X-Men manage to save the space crew  Jean is stranded in deep space and absorbs the solar flare into her body. Nightcrawler brings her body back into the X-Jet  with Jean surviving the event and her psychic powers greatly amplified as a result. However  they become uncontrollable and she accidentally unleashes her power on her fellow mutants at the X-Mansion  injuring her boyfriend Cyclops in the process.Xavier reveals that he had placed mental barriers within Jean's mind to block out the trauma of the car accident; additionally  he had lied about both of her parents' dying in the accident  as it turns out her father  John Grey  is still alive. Jean leaves the X-Mansion and returns to her family home  where she encounters her family. However  she notices that there are only photos of her mother in the house  and questions her father as to why he never looked for her following the accident.After Jean informs him that she can read minds  John intentionally recalls the entire incident mentally so that Jean could see  and it is shown that Jean rendered her mother unconscious while driving  thereby killing her. As John considered his wife the most important person in his world  he resented Jean for causing his wife's death and  upon meeting Xavier  had given her custody of Jean.The X-Jet then arrives on the street and the X-Men corner Jean  who retaliates  injuring Quicksilver and killing Mystique in the process. Jean also attacks police officers  prompting public reception towards her and mutants in general to become sour. Jean then travels to Genosha  a mutant safe haven run by Magneto  and asks him for help to prevent herself from killing more people.However  he orders her to leave after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Around this time  a shape-shifting alien race known as the D'Bari arrive on Earth with the purpose of harnessing the cosmic flare inside Jean in order to conquer Earth. Vuk  the leader of the D'Bari  encounters Jean and explains to her that what she absorbed was not a solar flare but in fact a cosmic energy entity that was responsible for eradicating the D'Bari home planet years ago. The power had consumed all those it came across with the exception of Jean.Back at the X-Mansion  Beast blames Xavier for Raven's death. Defecting from the X-Men  he flees the X-Mansion using the X-Jet and flies to Genosha  informing Magneto that Jean had murdered Mystique. He then joins Magneto  Ariki and Selene in traveling to New York City in order to assassinate Jean and avenge Mystique. Using Cerebro  Xavier realizes what their goal is and recruits Cyclops  Storm and Nightcrawler to save Jean's life. During the battle  both Magneto and Professor X encounter Jean  although Magneto is knocked out while Professor X is forced to walk without his wheelchair.While Xavier can no longer read Jean's mind  she can read his  and he shows her the memory he had with his father  where he expressed support and hope for Jean. The memory reasserts Jean's original personality  and she spares Xavier. She is then tempted by Vuk to transfer the cosmic energy to her; while Vuk is able to absorb some of it  she is struck by Cyclops before the transfer is completed. The military then intervenes  using collars that disable mutant powers to apprehend Professor X  Jean  Magneto  Cyclops  Storm  Nightcrawler  Ariki and Selene  while Vuk manages to escape.While on the train  one of the soldiers berates Nightcrawler  informing him that his son adored him prior to their actions. Meanwhile  Xavier informs Beast that he was wrong for what he had done to Jean  but that the real Jean still exists within; Cyclops also tells Beast and Magneto that Mystique had died believing that  and that she wouldn't have wanted them to kill Jean.The train is then attacked by Vuk and the D'Bari  who easily overpower the soldiers. Nightcrawler convinces the soldier whose son had idolized them to free them  and he does so; the X-Men and Magneto's faction proceed to team up to attack the D'Bari  although they are unable to defeat Vuk  who subdues them all.Xavier apologizes to Jean for what he had done  explaining that he just wished to give her what he deserved every child deserved - love and family. Jean then frees herself from her restraints  declaring that she would protect her family. Jean shields Magneto and her fellow X-Men while destroying the train they are on. She then swiftly disintegrates the remaining D'Bari forces before being attacked by Vuk  who begins to absorb Jean's remaining cosmic power.As Jean attempts to use the power to eliminate Vuk as well  she realizes that Cyclops is beginning to disintegrate as well. Knowing that she cannot unleash her energy on Earth without harming innocents  Jean takes a hold of Vuk and flies into space  where she reabsorbs the cosmic energy and explodes  killing Vuk and seemingly herself as well.The remaining X-Men return to New York  where the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is renamed the Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters. Xavier retires from his position as Headmaster  granting the dean to Beast  and moves to Paris  France  where he encounters Magneto  who requests they play a game of chess and offers him a home  just as Xavier had done for him before.As two start playing a flaming phoenix appears high in the sky...  , 'A Phoenix will rise.

-86.365231,2019,Stuber,116,93,6.2,3050,20190712,0,0,1,1,1,0,0, 'The film starts with Detectives Vic Manning (Dave Bautista) and Sara Morris (Karen Gillan) arriving at a hotel to catch notorious drug lord Oka Teijo (Iko Uwais). Teijo gets the drop on them and starts to fight Vic before running away. The detectives chase Teijo out of the hotel and into the streets. Morris gets close enough to catch Teijo  but as they fight for her gun  Teijo ends up shooting Morris in the abdomen. The crook gets away as Vic rushes to his partner\'s side to save her  but she soon dies.Six months later  we meet Stu (Kumail Nanjiani)  who works at a sporting goods store while taking a side job as an Uber driver. He is forced to give a ride to his obnoxious boss Richie Sandusky (Jimmy Tatro)  who runs his father\'s store and also gives him the unwanted nickname  Stuber . Stu is also investing in opening a spin class gym with his college friend Becca (Betty Gilpin)  with whom he is in love. However  she is dating a superstar basketball player  and Stu is none too pleased. He also really needs to maintain a rating above four stars  or he loses the Uber gig  and typically  his rides do not go over well.Vic has been obsessing over catching Teijo and avenging Morris. Captain Angie McHenry (Mira Sorvino) tells Vic to let it go now that the case against Teijo is being bumped up to the feds. Vic later goes to get Lasik eye surgery before meeting with his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales). She invites him to her art gallery later that night  which he promises to attend even though he can\'t see anything. Nicole installs the Uber app on his phone to help him out.Vic later gets a call from his informant  Leon (Amin Joseph)  who frantically tells Vic about a heroin drop with Teijo happening later that night. Vic jumps at the chance to get in on the case  and he heads to meet with Leon  but because he can\'t see  he drives all over the place  knocks things over  and finally drives into a construction hole. He then has no choice but to call for an Uber. Stu is that Uber driver  and he goes to pick Vic up and take him to Koreatown to meet with Leon.The two arrive at the warehouse where Leon is  but Vic finds that he is already dead. He takes Leon\'s phone  but he unknowingly leaves behind bloody footprints. From what he can see on the phone  Leon\'s last contact was someone by the name of Amber Titties (Amber Chardae Robinson)(but it\'s French and pronounced  Tee-tee-ay ). Vic forces Stu to keep driving him  making Compton their next destination. Meanwhile  Stu gets a video call from Becca  who is pissed and drunk after seeing that her boyfriend has nude photos of other girls on there. She invites Stu to come over and comfort her  and he promises to be there after dealing with Vic.Stu brings Vic to a male strip club  and Vic makes Stu go inside with him. They meet Amber  who runs the place and is aggressive to one of the dancers  Felix (Steve Howey)  for eating a sandwich when he has to look buff. Vic goes to talk to her about Leon  and she says that he was involved with a dealer named Amo Cortez (Rene Moran). Stu talks to Felix about Becca  revealing that they had sex a while back  but they both act like it was no big deal. Felix encourages him to express his feelings to her. Becca calls Stu again and says that her boyfriend called and sounded apologetic  so she is close to forgiving him  but still wants Stu to come over. However  Vic is not done with Stu and wants him to drive to Long Beach to find Amo. Stu begrudgingly joins him. Amber can then be seen calling someone to tell them about Stu and Vic.The guys go to a house where Vic enters to interrogate Amo and his buddies. He is enraged to find that they were smuggling drugs inside their dog  and he pulls the guy outside to arrest him. He places him in Stu\'s car and makes him think Stu is his partner. Vic even gives Stu a small gun to sell it. Amo quickly realizes Stu is just an Uber driver  and he attempts to escape by breaking through the window. Stu tries to stop him and accidentally shoots Amo in the leg. Vic starts to pry info from Amo  learning that a heroin drop is going down that night  but Amo passes out from shock before he can tell Vic where it\'s happening.Vic orders Stu to take him to a vet that knows him so that they can treat Amo\'s leg. After Amo wakes up  Vic tries to once again use brute force to get into out of him  but Stu opts for a different option: getting into Amo\'s phone and trying to send messages on Twitter that he wouldn\'t want his buddies to read (mostly about being a fan of Ryan Gosling and spreading rumors about his boss wearing diapers). Amo spills that the drop is happening after midnight at a storage yard. Just then  a group of Teijo\'s goons enters  and the leader holds Stu at gunpoint. They try to negotiate a swap of Stu for Amo  but Vic calls their bluff and knows they\'ll just kill all three of them to get rid of loose ends. Stu faints  and Vic starts to exchange fire with the goons. Amo gets killed before he and Stu take cover. Still being unable to see  Vic is only able to get any shots by hearing wherever Stu throws something. He misses on the leader  but Vic catches him after he steps on a cat\'s tail  and Vic puts a bullet in his head. Stu pukes and freaks out over all the dead bodies. They then flee the scene while still looking like crap  but Vic sends a text on the leader\'s phone to who he thinks is Teijo to make him think that Vic is dead. The text instead goes to McHenry  who is already at Nicole\'s art gallery.The two make it to the art show  and Vic makes a fool of himself by bumping into things and not even noticing Nicole\'s art. She meets Stu  and he shares his whole day dealing with her dad. Vic then goes to Nicole and asks her for the keys to their house for his storage unit  which she realizes is the only reason he showed up. She tells him off for being absent in her life and caring more about his job than the people in his own life. Vic leaves her with a gun for protection. Stu and Vic leave  and Vic throws a rock through a nearby shop to bring cops there (but also because he\'s mad).The guys go to the sporting goods store to get what Vic says is a few guns  but he really just grabs a bunch of stuff off the racks. Stu finally puts his foot down and calls Vic out for how he acts  telling him that he is scared of showing his emotions by hiding behind his masculinity  as well as him being a terrible dad to Nicole. The two then start fighting with items from around the store  like baseball bats and bicycles. They are then caught by Richie  who aims a crossbow at them. He makes fun of Stu again  but Stu then tells Richie off for the kind of person he is  and Stu quits on the spot. As he is leaving  Richie tries to convince him to stay because he considers Stu his best (and only) friend. Stu tries to say one nice thing to Richie before leaving for good.Stu drives Vic to the storage yard to catch Teijo. While staking out  Vic calls McHenry for backup. As this happens  Stu calls Becca and comes clean about his feelings for her  but he makes it sound like she put some kind of pressure on him to admit it to himself. Although she is still open to Stu coming over  he feels that they should just not talk to each other at all since he won\'t be able to ignore his feelings for her  but he will give her a call when he is ready. McHenry then shows up and reveals herself as a dirty cop to Vic. It turns out she and Teijo killed Leon and orchestrated the whole thing to get Vic framed for murder and off their tail. She shoots Vic once  but before she can kill him  Stu drives his car into her and slams her against a wall. Teijo and his goons spot them and begin to shoot and chase after the guys. Stu drives away while Vic regains his sight and is able to shoot at the bad guys. Stu throws a propane tank for Vic to shoot so it can blow up  and it works. Unfortunately  Stu\'s electric car runs out of battery  and Teijo catches up and slams his car into theirs  knocking it down a hill and forces the guys to run.Teijo finds the two as they run through a factory  and his wild shooting forces the employees out. The guys hide with the employees in a van  where they try to call multiple Ubers to get them out of there and to also make Teijo think that it\'s police backup. But one of the drivers blows the whole thing  and the drivers flee once Teijo starts shooting again. Vic and Teijo fight  with Stu failing to take a shot at Teijo before he knocks them both down. Nicole shows up after getting Vic\'s location off the Uber app  and shoots Teijo a couple of times before he gets a hold of the gun and attempts to shoot Nicole while Vic is down. Stu takes the bullet for Nicole  and Vic rages out by trying to strangle Teijo before Nicole stops him as real cops show up to arrest Teijo.Stu and Vic both wake up in the hospital. Nicole thanks the two of them for what they did. Stu gets up to leave  but not before Vic gives him a five-star rating. He thanks Stu for saving Nicole\'s life  and it brings him to tears.It is now Christmas time. Becca opened the spin class gym on her own  which Stu remains an investor in  and it is a big success. Vic is seen eating in a Chinese restaurant with the dog he saved from Amo\'s house. He walks it to Nicole\'s house  where she reveals that she and Stu are now dating. Vic is left speechless as he comes in to celebrate with them  as the movie closes on a 5 star wreath (referencing Stu\'s recent success).' , 'Prepare for the Rideshare of Your Life'  'Buckle up for a ***** ride'  'A Five-Star Driver Becomes A Five-Star Hero.'

He is alive and awake  but barely moving. We begin hearing his thoughts. Life as he knows it is close to the end  but he talks about how he once was watching television and learned about what Mongolians believe about dogs. They are reincarnated and return as dogs  and when they finally live a full life  they come back once more  as humans. We also learn that he believes being unable to communicate with humans is a curse. He is waiting for Denny  his master  and best friend.Denny comes home and finds Enzo  a golden retriever  unable to even move from the puddle of urine he is laying in. Denny knows the end is nearing. He picks up Enzo and takes him to the couch. Enzo then begins telling us about his life.Enzo is a puppy and is in a large box/pen outside with the rest of the litter. He tells that even then he knew he was different. Denny arrives and walks up to the pack of puppies. Enzo walks over right to Denny. He begins licking him  and the two quickly form a bond. After the couple who are selling the dogs do a little routine so they can get more money  Denny asks how much for the puppy.Denny arrives at a garage and takes Enzo out of the car. He introduces him to his friends. One of his friends points out that he\'s going to have to take care of the puppy and will have to make time for him. The other asks if he is coming to his band\'s concert that night. Denny quickly responds he has to stay home with Enzo.Denny leaves and goes to his job. He teaches auto racing and his boss  Don  thinks highly of him. He also helps get him jobs as a GT race driver. When he\'s not racing or teaching  Denny and Enzo are inseparable. Enzo tells us he loved Denny unconditionally and Denny takes him for runs and watches races on TV with him. Denny says that even though Enzo is a dog  he is a racer at heart and Enzo agrees.A year quickly goes by  and the two have settled into a routine. Then  while they are grocery shopping  Denny meets Eve. Enzo can sense Denny\'s interest in Eve  and is jealous. He tries to drag Denny away from her literally  but Denny reins in Enzo and asks Eve to his friend\'s concert. He jokes and says they are Seattle\'s third-best SoundGarden cover band.They begin dating and quickly fall in love. While Eve is incredibly supportive of Denny  Enzo does not feel that close to her  but he tries because he knows she is important to Denny.Soon the couple is married  and they make it work even though Denny has to leave most weekends to race. Eve\'s parents  who Enzo refers to as the  twins   clearly do not approve of Denny\'s career. They don\'t like that he\'s gone often and doesn\'t make much money. The mother is more accepting than the father. He races well  but different circumstances cost him from ever making it big. Eve becomes pregnant  and Denny is happy. Enzo even senses a change in Eve and begins to accept her. One night she even has him rest his chin on her belly  and he feels the baby kick. Enzo even admits to being jealous that she can carry a baby in her while it is assembled. He\'s okay with it but wants the baby to look like him when it is born.Denny accepts an endurance race in Daytona but is unsure of following through since it is close to Eve\'s due date. Always supportive  she says she\'s not due until two weeks after and she has never been early for anything. He leaves.Enzo watches Denny\'s race on the television and Eve goes through childbirth. She gives birth to a daughter  which she names Zoe. When the midwives are done and Eve is holding Zoe comfortably in bed  she tells Enzo to come on over. Enzo quickly arrives and loves the baby  describing her as like nothing he has ever seen before. However  he does not love one her gifts  a stuffed animal zebra.Denny returns home and says he should have been there. Clearly  Eve\'s parents are not thrilled that he wasn\'t  but they don\'t let on. Eve assures Enzo that they are fine and it\'s okay he \'wasn\'t there. He tells her he raced well  but he was replaced at the end by an upcoming driver who crashed just before the end. He raced well  but since his team didn\'t even finish  it means nothing and will not be his big break.Time quickly passes  and we see the family over time. We see a conversation between Denny and Eve about racing when it rains. She asks him if it scares him. He said he doesn\'t. He talks about how you can give in to that fear  and if you do you  then you have given up control. He tells her how he begins the skid before the turn  so he controls it. He doesn\'t give up control of the car  ever.Time passes  and Zoe gets older. Eve continues her job as a teacher  and Enzo enjoys the family. Eve complains of a headache one day. Soon after  we learn Enzo can smell the cancer in her head. He describes a \'rotting wood\' odor come from her. Unable to communicate this  though  life goes on for the family.Later  Eve is very sick while Denny is away. She is vomiting into the kitchen sink. She rushes out with Zoe and leaves Enzo all alone. Enzo soon runs out of food and must drink water from the toilet. He finds the occasional cheerio on the floor. One night  during a lightning storm  Enzo says he is hallucinating. He sees Zoe\'s evil zebra rip another stuffed animal apart and then the zebra rips out its own stuffing.After a few days  Denny comes home and feeds Enzo. He calls Eve and asks her to come home. She does  and Zoe is upset when she finds all of her stuffed animals and toys ripped to shreds. Denny scolds Enzo and even yells he is a stupid dog. Eve tells him to stop berating the dog. Later  Denny finds Enzo in the yard and apologizes to him.Sometime after Eve is walking with Enzo in the woods  Eve is struggling but keeps telling Enzo (who loves Eve) that she is alright. Suddenly Eve passes out and Enzo barks until help arrives.Eve stays in the hospital while she undergoes tests and is treated. Denny takes care of Zoe and doesn\'t have as much time for Enzo. Eve is discharged and lives with her parents. Denny and Zoe spend time with her  while he condition deteriorates. One night  Enzo goes over to Eve. She admits she is no longer scared. She knows while this the end to her life here  there is more for her after this life. Enzo tells us he watched as she took her last breath. He says he watched her soul depart her body and leave for its next stage.The family has a funeral  and soon after  Denny\'s in-laws confront him. They want custody of Zoe and threaten to sue him. Maxwell  Eve\'s father  finally tells Denny what he thinks and Denny tells Zoe they are leaving and to grab her stuff. Maxwell grabs Denny\'s arm. Denny pulls it away  and Maxwell falls breaking a rib. Eve\'s mother  Trish  had her back turned during this event. Denny and Zoe leave.Denny hires his lawyer friend  Mark  who says it is an open and shut case. He should have no fear of losing Zoe. Then  while at work  Denny is arrested for assault. Maxwell is lying about what happened and says Denny was the aggressor. Mark tells Denny if he is convicted  he may never see his daughter again and that she is with the grandparents for the next 90 days. He cannot call or see her. Enzo is upset by this too.During this time  Denny is offered a job in Italy testing and racing new prototypes for Ferrari. He tells them he cannot leave the state or accept such a job because of all that is going on in his life. The man gives him his business card and tells him he understands and if things should change to give him a call.Denny is upset. The 90 days pass and through his in-laws submit a deal. Denny doesn\'t know what to do but says he will fight. One night  Denny goes running with Enzo like they used to do  but Enzo  older  struggles to keep pace. Lagging behind  he attempts to follow Denny across the street. He is hit by a car. Denny rushes him to a 24-hour animal hospital.The vet tells Denny that Enzo is extremely lucky. He will survive  but that this could cause problems in the future. He doesn\'t have enough money to pay the vet fully.Enzo starts to come out of a drug-induced haze a few weeks later. He sees Denny about to agree to a lousy custody deal. Just in time  Enzo grabs the legal document and rips it to shreds. Denny understands Enzo\'s message and decides to fight it.Later  Denny\'s friend comes over to watch Enzo as Denny heads to court. Enzo is nervous and anxious to find out what happened. Denny calls his friend to tell him what happened.We find out through a brief flashback to the court proceedings that Eve\'s mother began to lie on the stand and say she saw Denny push Maxwell to the ground. She is dismissed as a witness  but she can\'t bring herself to leave things this way. She admits the truth and the charges are dropped. Denny will win and receive full custody of his daughter.Denny calls the Ferrari representative and agrees to take the job. His new boss is thrilled to hear this  and Enzo is excited to be moving to Italy.Denny throws Zoe a birthday party. His in-laws show up uninvited. Denny still graciously invites them in. While the party goes on  Enzo  weakened by age  sleeps under that table.Cut to the beginning of the movie. We see the exact opening scene  but this time it plays on longer. Denny has the ailing dog on the couch with him. He puts on racing and gets an idea.Denny takes Zoe and Enzo to the race track where he used to teach. His old boss lets him drive Enzo on the track. Enzo talks about all he has learned and that he is sure his next life will be that of a human. He tells us he will be more prepared than other babies starting out and what he laments  like not being able to see Italy. He tells us he knows Denny will make it. He will wow people during testing and get his big break. He will become a great Formula One racer. Denny continues to go faster and Enzo barks to let him know he wants one more lap. The screen fades to white.Eight years pass and Denny and Zoe are living in Italy. A man and a boy are introduced to Denny who is in full racing gear. The father speaks for the boy and says his son is a big fan. He was wondering if Denny would give the boy an autograph. Denny agrees to and asks the boys name. He is Enzo. Denny smiles and tells the father the boy reminds him of an old friend. The father and boy thank Denny and are ready to leave. Denny stops them and gives the father his number. He tells him that when his son is ready  he will train the boy. The father is touched and thanks Denny.' , 'Meet the Dog Who Will Show the World How to Be Human'

One of these surges strikes the Earth while Roy is working on the Tower. He is forced to jump from the highest section and freefalls for miles before he opens his parachute and lands safely on the ground. The source of the deadly surges is being investigated.Roy is the son of famed astronaut H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones). In a top-secret briefing  he is informed by U.S. Space Command (SpaceCom) that the surges have been traced to the  Lima Project  (near Neptune)  a deep space mission launched 26 years earlier to explore the limits of the Solar System for intelligent life where the Sun\'s magnetic field won\'t interfere with incoming signals from alien life. The mission was lead by Clifford and hasn\'t been heard from in 16 years after reaching Neptune. Roy is informed that the Lima project was powered by anti-matter and the surges have the characteristics of an uncontrolled chain reaction. If the reaction gets anymore out of hand  it will destroy the solar system. Roy\'s mission is to contact his father from Mars and try and ascertain the situation.Informed that Clifford may still be alive  Roy accepts a mission to travel to Mars to try to establish communication with him  joined by his father\'s old associate Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland). Roy\'s mental and physical acuity is tested several time revealing that he is emotionally detached but also very calm in a crisis  his heart rate never rising above 80 beats a minute  even during the incident on the tower. He has no emotional reaction to his wife  Eve (Liv Tyler)  leaving him  or to the news that his father may still be alive.After taking a commercial flight to the Moon  Roy and Pruitt are escorted by US military personnel to the SpaceCom base  located on the far side of the moon. Moon is borderless and has many disputed mining territories engaged in a state of war. En route in lunar rovers  they are ambushed by scavenging pirates who kill their entire escort. Upon arrival at the base  a dying Pruitt is placed into intensive care. Before he loses consciousness  Pruitt tells Roy that if Roy can\'t make contact with his dad  SpaceCom will take all measures to destroy Clifford\'s station and put an end to the surges.Roy transfers to the ship Cepheus  bound for Mars. The ship receives a distress signal from a Norwegian bio-medical research space station. The Cepheus stops to investigate despite Roy\'s protests  and Roy and the captain make their way to the station. It appears abandoned and the two split up  but Roy soon discovers an escaped baboon test subject feeding on the captain\'s corpse. It attacks him when it notices his presence  but he manages to kill it. Another baboon attempts to attack him  but he quickly subdues it and locks it in another module. He then kills it instantly as it attempts to open the door by depressurizing the chamber. Believing that he can save the captain  he tapes over the broken helmet visor of the captain\'s spacesuit and carries him back to the ship  where he is declared to be already dead. A brief service is held where the captain\'s body is ejected into space. Again  Roy appears to be very emotionless and calm after the violent encounter and death of the captain. He does admit that he experiences rage  and recalls his father expressing his rage.Another surge hits as the Cepheus lands on Mars  requiring manual piloting to complete the landing. The interim captain freezes in fear  while Roy remains very calm and takes command of the ship  landing it safely. Roy is led to the underground SpaceCom base where he meets facility director Helen Lantos (Ruth Negga) and is tasked with recording voice messages to send to the Lima Project in hopes that Clifford will respond. During one recording  Roy goes off-script with an emotional appeal to his father and is abruptly taken off the mission on the grounds of his personal connection posing a risk to himself and the mission\'s success. From the visible reaction of the recording observation team to his emotional recording  he assumes correctly that an immediate response from his father had been received and demands to hear it.Sequestered in a  comfort room   he is visited by Lantos  who reveals that she was born on Mars and was the daughter of Lima Project crew-members. She shows Roy classified footage revealing that Clifford\'s crew had mutinied and tried to return to Earth  causing him to turn off their life-support systems  her parents included. She tells Roy that the crew that brought him to Mars are leaving to destroy the Lima Project station with a nuclear payload. The two decide that Roy should confront Clifford himself  and Helen sneaks Roy to an underground lake beneath the rocket launch site.Roy clandestinely climbs aboard as the rocket takes off and is subsequently discovered by the crew  who are instructed to neutralize him. The entire crew is killed in the ensuing brutal fight. During the long journey to Neptune  a solitary Roy reflects on his relationships with his father and Eve. The isolation and stress of the mission take a mental toll  but after several weeks he arrives at the Lima Project. Roy finds the Lima Project craft to be degrading around Neptune\'s orbit. He leaves the Cepheus on auto pilot and takes a shuttle to maneuver around Neptune\'s rings.The shuttle is damaged in a collision with the fragments in Neptune\'s rings  preventing it from docking with the station. Roy enters the station via a space-walk while the shuttle drifts away. Finding the station abandoned and encountering the dead bodies of its crew  he plants the nuclear payload before encountering Clifford  the station\'s sole survivor  who confirms that the surges are coming from the ship\'s malfunctioning antimatter power source  which had been damaged in the mutiny. Clifford has continued to work on the project  refusing to lose faith in the possibility of non-human intelligent life. Clifford is reluctant to go back to Earth as there is nothing for him there. He admits that he doesn\'t love his own son or his wife.After Clifford agrees to accompany him back to Earth  Roy finishes arming the payload and they climb out on the station\'s surface in preparation for returning to the Cepheus. Clifford suddenly uses his spacesuit\'s thrusters to launch the two of them off into space. With Clifford pleading for Roy to untether them from each other  Roy reluctantly does so and manages to propel himself back to the Cepheus using his own spacesuit and with a piece of the station\'s hull as a shield against Neptune\'s ring debris. Without enough fuel to return to Earth  he relies on the shock wave from the nuclear explosion in the station to gain the required speed.\nThe data retrieved from the base suggests that humans are the only intelligent life in the universe  however  Clifford has collected a vast amount of information about other planets  more than humankind has ever known. Roy is inspired to reconnect with those closest to him  and he returns to Earth with a newfound optimism. After expressing his opinions in a psychological evaluation  he reconnects with Eve.' , 'The Answers We Seek Are Just Outside Our Reach'

Warm and likable  he\'s a natural salesman and a people person. He is also an incredible vehicle designer and engineer. Meanwhile  Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is a racer currently working as a mechanic and running his own shop to support his wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe). He tells it like it is and sometimes gets customers angry  but he doesn\'t sugarcoat anything. At a race  Ken is told his car does not meet regulations and begins angrily yelling at the race official - Carroll spots this and calms him down  but afterward  the two get into an argument  and Ken throws a wrench at him. Later  the IRS comes and shuts down Ken\'s garage  and he\'s forced to give up most of his racing in order to take care of his family.Meanwhile  at Ford Motors  Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) is furious that sales are down and that his father\'s company is in danger. He begins taking pitches from his underlings - Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) pitches him an idea - the sexiest cars are race cars  like Ferraris. He posits that if Ford can win the Le Mans  the 24-hour race  they will be at the top. In order to do that  they fly to Italy in order to offer the struggling Ferrari a deal - they will buy the company and let Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) maintain control of the racing division. Ferrari uses this offer to get Fiat to make a good offer  and they buy Ferrari. Ferrari tells the Ford businessmen to shove it and calls Henry a fat pig. When they get back  Henry makes them relay in detail what Ferrari said  and he becomes more determined than ever to beat Ferrari. He decides they will start their own racing division.Lee approaches Carroll  as the only American to ever win at Le Mans  if he would be the head of their racing team  designing and testing the cars. Carroll agrees - and goes to Ken  the best driver he knows  to take part. When Mollie sees Ken heading out with Carroll  she angrily demands to know the truth. He tells her that he\'s been offered great pay to race  and she\'s thrilled - she just doesn\'t want him to ever lie to her. The team begins getting the car into shape for their first big race  but as it approaches  Ford vice president Leo Bebee (Josh Lucas)  approaches Carroll and tells them that Ken\'s rakish  unpredictable quality is not part of the Ford brand and he can\'t be trusted to do press and represent Ford well and that he can\'t be their driver. Carroll fights for Ken  but is eventually forced to tell Ken that he won\'t be racing - Ken is furious. When Ford loses the race  Carroll is able to convince Henry to allow him to rehire Ken. He goes to Ken\'s house and apologizes and asks him to come back  and the two end up getting into a physical fight on his front lawn. They finally give up  exhausted  and Mollie brings them some cold sodas.Ken rejoins the team  who are working day and night trying to perfect the car. Lee warns Carroll that Leo is determined to have Ken removed from the team  and intend on doing so on their next visit. Knowing this  when Henry and Leo arrive  Carroll locks Leo in his office and takes Henry out for a ride in the race car  and Henry experiences just how terrifying and exhilarating racing is. When they stop  he breaks down into sobs. Carroll offers him a deal - let Ken race at Daytona - if they win  he races at Le Mans in France. If they lose  Henry gets full control over Carroll\'s company. At Daytona  they find tough competition in a second Ford team that Ford had commissioned to see who engineered the best vehicle. Ken is able to win the race  securing their team the spot at Le Mans and ensuring Ken will drive there.In France  Le Mans approaches. Ferrari and Henry are both in attendance. When the race starts  Ken\'s door won\'t shut  slowing him down on the first lap. The car that they had designed was able to accelerate to really high speeds  but doing so burned out the brakes  so deep into the race  the pit crew changes out the brakes. The Italians at Ferrari are furious  saying this is a violation of the rules  but Carroll points out the rule-book says they are allowed to change parts  and it isn\'t specified which ones. Eventually  Ferrari\'s car spins out and crashes  leaving Ken in first place  and Mollie and Peter are able to watch on TV as Ken completes his much-desired  perfect  leg. Leo  who had been trying to bypass Carroll and mess with their strategy  goes to Henry and suggests that the best image for Ford would be to have all three of their cars cross the finish together. He agrees  and Leo gives Carroll the order  who refuses. Carroll tells Ken the instruction but tells him it\'s his race  and he will stand behind him no matter what. At first  Ken speeds to the victory  but he eventually relents and slows down  allowing the other drivers to catch up and cross the finish together. Everyone celebrates Ken\'s win until a technicality - he started behind another car - puts him into second  not first. Carroll is furious  but Ken accepts it  and the two go off together.Weeks later  while testing a new car design  the J-Car  Ken  who is not wearing safety gear while driving it  crashes and is killed. Carroll goes to his family\'s home and finds Peter  whom he gives the wrench that Ken threw at him. He gets into his car  and despite his condition  speeds off into the distance. The post-script tells us that Carroll\'s cars won the Le Mans four years and that Ken was inducted posthumously into the racing hall of fame.' , 'They took the American dream for a ride.'

Christian goes to Dani's apartment to console her.Several months later  Dani tries to contain her grief. She hangs out with Christian and his friends and learns about their trip to Sweden to a midsommar celebration in the Harga  a village where Pelle grew up. The celebration occurs every 90 years and lasts about nine days. Josh  in particular  is interested since he wants to write about the experience for his anthropology dissertation.

Three of the villagers proceed to smash his head with a sledgehammer. Simon and Connie express their absolute horror  while Dani goes back to her room. An elder villager woman  Siv (Gunnel Fred)  explains to the group that this is a natural part of their ritual  as the two elders reached what they felt was the end of their life cycle  and prolonging it further would have been bad. Pelle goes to comfort Dani  thinking that her distress is linked more to her recent tragedy than it is to what she just witnessed. He attempts to console Dani  but she thinks him getting close to her is inappropriate since Christian could come in. Pelle then questions how much Christian really means to Dani  based on how he is around her.Dani later has a nightmare that Christian and his friends are leaving without her. They drive away in the middle of the night as she watches them go  and she is plagued by haunting imagery of her dead family and the corpses of the two elders.After what they saw  Simon and Connie plan to leave  but when Connie is ready to go  she is told that Simon went off with another villager to the train that would take them home. Connie is angered that Simon would leave without her  and she proceeds to walk off on her own. Meanwhile  Christian tells Josh he also wants to do his thesis on the Harga  but Josh is not happy about that. He argues that Christian can never just do his own thing instead of picking off what Josh is doing. Christian offers to ask the elders if they are allowed to collaborate on the project. Josh later learns that the village's ritualistic practices are based on paintings made by a member named Ruben (Levente Puczko-Smith)  a deformed boy who was the product of incest but is viewed as some kind of seer. Josh asks to take pictures of Ruben's drawings  but he is forbidden.The elders' bodies are buried in the middle of the village. Their ashes are spread across an ancestral tree  which Mark pisses on. He is scolded by Ulf (Henrik Norlen)  who actually breaks down sobbing at the act. Mark is then told the significance of the tree  but he has a callous reaction over it. Elsewhere  Christian and Josh are told that they are allowed to collaborate on their thesis  on the condition that they omit the actual names and location of the Harga. The two agree. Christian also asks about the village's mating rituals  inquiring as to whether incest was typical there  and he is told that incest isn't necessarily frowned upon  but outsiders are usually brought in to procreate with the villagers. A feast is then held  where Mark notices Ulf is staring daggers in his direction. Dani also overhears that Connie was taken to the station by one of the villagers. Mark is then taken away by a female villager  and the others never see him again.\nLater that night  Josh sneaks into the room where Ruben's book of paintings is kept. He is interrupted by who he thinks is Mark before he gets bludgeoned over the head. We then see that the figure is actually a villager wearing Mark's face. Josh is then dragged away.The next morning  Dani  Christian  and Pelle are told that Ruben's book has gone missing  and Josh and Mark disappearing looks suspicious. Afterwards  Dani joins the women in the village in a competition where they dance around a maypole before each woman is eliminated. After taking a drug  Dani finds herself being able to speak in Swedish with the other women. Dani is the last one standing  and she is crowned the May Queen. At the same time  Christian is given a drink that induces a trip. He is lured and taken to take Maja's virginity. He has sex with her while the other elder females stand nude around them and mimic Maja's moaning. After Dani is crowned May Queen  she watches Christian having sex with Maja through a hole in the door  which causes Dani to have a breakdown. She goes to cry  and the other women join her  sympathetically crying loudly with her. After climaxing  a mortified Christian runs out to try and find Dani  but he ends up discovering Josh's leg buried in the dirt  as well as Simon's mutilated corpse being used as a blood eagle. Moments later  he is found and knocked out when a villager blows powder in his face.The end of the ritual draws near  and the elders bring the drugged Christian  along with a villager named Torbj??rn  before Dani  as she is supposed to choose someone for a sacrifice. As per tradition  nine people are to be sacrificed. This includes the two elders  four outsiders  two living volunteers  and one chosen by Dani. After all that she has gone through  she picks Christian.The men in the village take a fully grown bear and disembowel it so they can place Christian inside the bear's corpse. They bring him  Ingemar  and the corpses of Simon  Connie  Josh  and Mark to the golden teepee  which is then set on fire. Unable to move or speak  Christian succumbs to his fate while only being able to wheeze in pain  while Ulf screams in terror and ingemar watches. The villagers mimic the screams  while Dani appears to breakdown from what is happening again. However  as she continues to watch the teepee go up in flames  and hears the unified wailing of the villagers  a demented smile begins to form on her face.  , 'Let the festivities begin'

Billi (Awkwafina) lives in New York with her parents Haiyan (Tzi Ma) and Jian (Diana Lin) but remains pretty close to her grandmother in China  Nai Nai (Shuzehen Zhou) and talk on the phone all the time. Billi gets a call from Nai Nai in the morning in NYC and gets fussed over like all grandmas do over their grand kids. What Nai Nai doesn\'t tell her is  she\'s in the hospital for some tests accompanied by her sister  Little Nai Nai (Hong Lu). They agree they\'ll talk later and Nai Nai goes for a CT scan. Her sister goes to talk to the doctor afterwards and then tells Nai Nai there\'s nothing wrong  just  some benign shadows. Billi is not really doing well in her life  and while on the phone with Nai Nai later on that day  she opens a letter that says her application for a Guggenheim fellowship has been rejected. She keeps this information from Nai Nai and everybody else.Billi goes to visit her parents and her mom gives her grief over the fact she doesn\'t have any money or seems to be moving forward with her life. She also tells her she and Haiyan are leaving for China the next day because their nephew Hao Hao is getting married to Aiko (who is Japanese and doesn\'t speak Chinese) and Billi is not to accompany them. When Billi questions why the wedding is so rushed  Jian hushes her as Hayan is sleeping. Billi asks why  since it\'s only 6:00PM  but Jian waves her off.Billi then goes in the bedroom where her father is sitting on the bed. She asks what\'s wrong because she can tell something is not right  and questions whether he\'s been drinking  which he denies. Hayan eventually tells her Nai Nai has stage four lung cancer and the wedding is just an excuse for everybody to go over there and see her. Billi says she must go  but her parents refuse. Jian says they\'re not telling Nai Nai about her condition because in China families believe if you tell someone they have cancer  they die  not because of the disease but of the fear. The reason they don\'t want her to go is  Billi\'s emotions show on her face and Nai Nai will know something is wrong.Billi eventually shows up in China  much to her parents\' dismay and Nai Nai\'s delight. Jian questions once again where Billi got the money for the plane ticket  but Billi doesn\'t reply  and shows her instead she can hide her feelings. From then on  it\'s all about the wedding planning and the differences between America and China  with Jian and YuPing (a distant relative) sniping back and forth about life opportunities in the two countries. Nai Nai cuts the arguments short by saying they can\'t criticize China  no matter what.Nai Nai teaches Billi some form of walking/breathing exercise that involves grunting out loud  so you can do it alone when you go back to America.  Billi struggles with the  we\'re not telling Nai Nai she has cancer  thing and keeps bringing it up  only to be shut down again and again. Eventually  after an evening of heavy drinking by the immediate family  Nai Nai goes to the hospital after a coughing attack. Once again  Billy brings up with the doctor the situation with Nai Nai  and he also advises against telling her about her condition. He tells Nai Nai the cough is leftover from the pneumonia she\'d had earlier in the year and it\'s a secondary infection. He agrees to change her medicine and orders an X-ray.Billi finds her father and uncle Haibin (Yongbo Jiang) smoking at the hotel where they\'re all staying  and she brings up the lying again. Haibin explains that the difference between living in America and in China is that in America people believe their life belong to themselves  whereas in China people\'s lives are part of a whole  of a family  of society  and therefore it is the family\'s duty to carry the emotional burden of the cancer knowledge FOR Nai Nai.Billi tells her mother she wants to stay in China to take care of Nai Nai but Jian is not having it and once again berates her daughter since she  can\'t cook  can\'t clean  what are you going to do?  Billi brings up she couldn\'t come to China when her grandpa (Ye Ye in Mandarin) died and how that affected her. Jian once again dismisses her.Before the wedding  Nai Nai asks Billi to be nice and courteous with the wedding guests  smiling and greeting them and agreeing to sing if called to do so. On the wedding day  after arguing with her sister for having to wait until Monday for her X-ray results  Nai Nai gets Billi\'s attention and gestures for her to smile  so Billi does what she\'s been asked to do and is nice to everybody. However  at the time of the speeches  Haibin  father of the groom  goes up on stage and basically loses it and starts crying which he attributes to being  very happy.  Billi also goes up on stage and makes a speech  aided by her dad who tells her the Mandarin Chinese for  congratulations.  They also do karaoke together to  Killing Me Softly.  After a raucous drinking game  Hao Hao starts crying inconsolably.When the time comes for the family picture with the bride and groom  Nai Nai questions why the groom is crying and once again she\'s told  tears of joy.  Little Nai Nai asks if they can take one with her camera  which Nai Nai says she gave to Mrs Gao (their maid) to hold. When Little Nai Nai asks where Mrs Gao is  Nai Nai says she sent her to the hospital to get the X-ray results.As soon as the picture is taken  Billi hightails it to the hospital to intercept Mrs Gao  which he does  only to realize Mrs Gao is illiterate and doesn\'t know what the test results are. Then Billi and Little Nai Nai take the results to a shop to have them altered to read  benign shadows.  When the shop employee questions what that means  Little Nai Nai snaps   It\'s not terminal! Nai Nai gets the test results and tells them all off   you worried for nothing! I told you I was fine!  After that  she meets with Billi before she leaves and gives her an envelope with money  because she\'d given one to Hao Hao so Billi gets one too. When Billi opposes  as she didn\'t get married  Nai Nai says that\'s more the reason for her to accept it  and to not spend it on something sensible like the rent  but to get herself something nice. Billi then confesses to Nai Nai she missed out on the fellowship  and Nai Nai advises that it\'s not so much what you do in life  but the way you do it.Billi and her parents are leaving and Nai Nai hugs Billi for the longest time before letting her go and assuring her they\'ll see each other again. Billi is back in New York City  unsure of what to do  and while walking down the street  she stops in her tracks and grunts loudly  like Nai Nai taught her. The movie ends.We\'re shown a video of the actual Nai Nai  who\'s still going strong six years after her stage four cancer diagnosis.' , 'Based on an Actual Lie'

On the first day of the job  Winslow notices that there is a hole in his cot. As he digs into it  he finds a small wooden figurine of a mermaid and stuffs it in his jacket. Wake is perceived by Winslow as a strange and superstitious fellow  going up to the top of the lighthouse at night and stripping nude. Winslow decides to shrug it off but is drawn towards the ocean. He sees floating tree stumps in the water along with a horrifying image of a mermaid in the deep. Then he wakes  revealing this to be a dream.Over the course of his stay  Winslow is allocated the more taxing jobs  refueling the light  stirring the oil barrack  carrying heavy gasoline containers  and disposing of the two men\'s chamber pots. As the weeks progress  Winslow becomes more and more curious as to Wake\'s obsession with the light. He constantly is encountered by a strange seagull that constantly seeks to annoy Winslow at every turn. Wake sees this and encourages Winslow at dinner to leave it alone because it\'s bad luck to kill a seagull. The weeks continue  and Winslow constantly retreats to the supply cabin to masturbate to the figurine of the mermaid  and like clockwork  he sees Wake up on the top level of the lighthouse bare naked. One night at dinner  the two decide to get to know each other. They finally introduce each other by name and discuss the previous wickie. Wake says that his previous keeper passed away shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow tells Wake about how he used to work up in the North but decided to change profession  and Wake asks if he was running away from something he did on the mainland  which Winslow quickly shrugs off. Winslow asks Wake why killing a seagull is a bad omen  and he explains that Seagulls are vessels for the souls of dead seamen  which Winslow also shrugs off.The day before Winslow is slated to leave  he notices a major jam in the oil barrack and goes to see what the fuss is about. He opens the chamber to see a dying seagull stuck inside. The other seagull who has been tormenting Winslow for the past month flies down to the oil barrack and attacks him. Winslow grabs the seagull and violently beats it to death against a rock. That afternoon  the winds finally stop  and Wake becomes paranoid that a storm is destined to attack the island  and therefore proposes that the two of them drown their sorrows in alcohol before the ferry comes tomorrow. They board up the windows  and the storm begins. As the night progresses and the two get drunker and drunker  Winslow asks to go up to the top level of the lighthouse  which leads to an argument between him and Wake. The next morning  the ferry is nowhere to be seen  and Winslow decides to continue with his morning routine. This is  however  cut short by a mysterious figure washing up on the shore. Winslow approaches the body  which appears to be a naked woman until he looks down and realizes that she is actually a mermaid. He runs back into the cottage to find Wake stating that the rations were impacted by the storm. Wake informs Winslow that they buried a secret stash of rations next to the lighthouse that they will need to get. The two dig up the giant crate  but it is revealed to only have more alcohol.Wake says it will likely take a longer time for the ferry to get here due to the storm. More nights progress and the two become closer as they drink more and continue to be at each other\'s throats. One night in the bedroom  Winslow  in a drunken stupor  harasses Wake and criticizes his cooking skills  leading Wake to verbally curse out Winslow  asking Neptune to strike him dead in a lengthy soliloquy. The days of the storm continue  and Winslow slowly begins to drink on his own  and he loses his composure and his concept of time. He sneaks up to the top level of the lighthouse but cannot enter without a key. As he gazes into the light  he begins to have visions of tentacles moving inside. Wake begins to psychologically manipulate Winslow until he reveals that his name is actually not Ephraim Winslow. He actually murdered a timber-man by that name and assumed his identity. Wake accuses Winslow of  spilling his beans   and later on  Winslow drunkenly breaks the mermaid figurine in half. Winslow has another vision of him pulling up a lobster cage from the depths of the sea  containing the severed head of Wake\'s previous Wickie. Eventually  Winslow can\'t take anymore and tries to kill Wake in his sleep to steal the key. This proves unsuccessful  and Winslow tries to leave. He pushes the lifeboat out of the cabin  but Wake sees this and uses an ax to destroy the boat. Wake chases Winslow into the cottage  but inside  Wake continues with more psychological manipulation  claiming that it was actually Winslow that chased Wake around the island with the ax. An undisclosed amount of time later  the two have another drunken party together  until the storm becomes so powerful that the waves crash through the windows and destroying the cottage.The next morning the two wakes in a flooded cottage and Winslow decides to pick up Wake\'s diary. Inside  he finds that Wake has decided not to pay Winslow for his services once the ferry comes to pick them up  leading to another argument. Wake finally reveals that he knows Winslow killed the seagull and brought bad omens upon the island. Winslow attacks Wake and starts envisioning him as different people: first as the real Ephraim Winslow  then as the mermaid  then as Poseidon himself. Enveloped in imaginary tentacles  he beats Wake into submission. He then ties a collar around Wake\'s neck and forces him to walk and act like a dog. He takes Wake over to the hole where they kept the crate of alcohol and covers Wake in the dirt until he passes out. Winslow uses this opportunity to steal the key off him and runs back into the cottage to find the cabinet. Wake  in a fit of rage  bursts into the cottage with the ax and hacks Winslow in the shoulder. Winslow overpowers Wake and impales Wake right in the head. Winslow then walks up to the top level of the lighthouse and finally sees what is inside the light. He is then overpowered by the brightness and begins to maniacally laugh until he slips and falls down the stairs all the way to the floor. The film ends with a final shot of Winslow lying naked on the rocks  seagulls picking at his insides.' , 'There is enchantment in the light.'  'Keeping secrets  are ye?'

She then asks him how he got in  and he holds up a set of keys. She asks him to leave so that she can get dressed  but he tells her not to flatter herself... he\'s not even looking at her. Steph enters the room and sits down on the bed with him. Tessa asks Steph to have her BF leave the room  to which Steph replies that he is not her BF and asks the boy what he had been saying to her to make her think that. The boy says he\'s been minding his business. Steph tells Tessa she is going out with them that night  but Tessa seems reluctant. The boy makes a snide comment about not being able to see her as the partying type. Tessa decides not to go. Steph and the boy get up to leave. Just as the boy is about to go out the door  he hands the book he was reading back to Tessa. He says that The Great Gatsby is a wonderful book  and he hates to spoil it for her  but it was all a dream. Tessa corrects him and says that actually  it was all a lie (important later). The boy smirks at her and leaves the room.Tessa is shown the next day at a campus coffee shop studying. A trio of people walk in (one of them being the rude boy from her room the night before). They order their drinks and Tessa makes eye contact with the boy  and he slightly smiles. They briefly stare at each other  and he turns and walks out with his friends. Tessa goes to the library to study. She is interrupted by Steph who tells her that they are going to a party that night. Steph helps Tessa pick out her party outfit. She settles on a maroon dress.They make their way into the frat party  and Steph meets up with Tristan in the kitchen  kissing her (she is her GF). This seems to shock Tessa slightly. They head into the living room where a group of friends lays on the couch. It is the trio from the coffee shop and another guy. Steph introduces Tessa to her friends. There is Zed (Samuel Larsen)  Jace the Townie (Swen Temmel)  Molly (Inanna Sarkis)  and the rude boy Hardin (Hero Fiennes-Tiffin). Molly and Hardin are laying with each other on the couch and touching & kissing each other.Zed inquires about Tessa\'s major - she wants to do something business or economics related. Jace offers Tessa a drink  which she initially refuses  but takes a swig after Molly makes fun of her. Molly suggests that they play a game of Truth or Dare. Tessa says that\'s a kids game  but Molly explains not the way that they play. Jace asks Tessa truth or dare  to which she chooses truth. Molly asks her where the craziest place she ever had sex was. Tessa is noticeably uncomfortable and asks to pass  and Molly picks up on it. She asks Tessa if she is a virgin. Tessa does not want to answer  so she asks for a dare. Jace dares Tessa to make out with Hardin. Hardin slowly gets up from the couch and walks over to her.Molly starts filming the encounter on her phone. He bends down and whispers  asking her she wanted to go through with it. They both stand up and after a few seconds of them looking into each other eyes...Tessa announces she\'s done playing the game and walks off. Hardin seems shocked by this  and the group teases Hardin about this being his first rejection. He turns to Molly (who is still filming) with a little look of disbelief on his face  but he slowly smiles. Tessa calls Noah outside on the porch of the party where he gets onto her about partying and drinking. She hangs up on him and heads back inside. She makes her way up the staircase and into one of the bedrooms. There is a Union Jack flag hanging on the wall and a shelf full of books. She sees a copy of Wuthering Heights with sticky notes throughout it. She opens it to one of the pages.Just as she begins to read  she is started by Hardin who asks her what she is doing. She asks him if he is drunk  which he says he doesn\'t drink... just like her. He sees that she has his copy of Wuthering Heights and recites some lines from it. He calls her Theresa and asks her if she knows it\'s Bronte. She corrects him and says her name is Tessa. Hardin then asks what she is doing in his room. She seems embarrassed that she is there. He grabs hold of the book  runs it up her inner thigh using it to lift up her dress slightly and leans into her. He asks if they are still playing b/c she owes him a dare.

She is shown laying in bed texting with Noah again and him apologizing for scolding her earlier... he wants what is best for her.Tessa makes her way into a class and looks for a spot to sit. She sees Molly and Zed in the crowd and avoids them. She finds Landon in the front and joins him. They are both excited to have been allowed to take this upper-level English Course. Hardin makes his way into the classroom and sits just as Professor Soto begins talking about the book \'Pride & Prejudice\'. She asks Hardin what his thoughts on the book are. Tessa seems perturbed that he is in her class. Hardin says that Elizabeth Bennett gave Mr. Darcy a hard time and he wasn\'t so bad. He believes that love is something that you can turn on and off  that it isn\'t real. Tessa raises her hand and says that she felt the novel was ahead of its time. Hardin interjects and says that\'s a load of crap. The banter back and forth in front of the classroom full of students. The disagreement has morphed into being about them and what happened between them the night before. Professor Soto ends the argument and Hardin looks pleased with himself  yet intrigued by Tessa\'s tenacity. Class dismisses  and Hardin follows Tessa out of the building exclaiming how much fun that was. Tessa scolds him and says that there is nothing between them. Hardin feigns ignorance and says he was only talking about the book disagreement they just had. Hardin walks off  and Landon joins her. Tessa voices her disapproval of how arrogant Hardin is. Landon says that Hardin is just being Hardin and he knows him well. Landon\'s mother is dating the University Chancellor... Chancellor Scott (who happens to be Hardin\'s dad). He says that they tolerate each other.We then see Tessa sitting at a tattoo shop while Jace inks Steph. They suggest that she gets one  but she refuses  saying her mother would kill her. She explains that her mother has her whole life planned out for and that she probably has already planned her wedding to Noah. Steph questions whether Noah is the only boy that Tessa has been with...which he is. Tessa is later shown laying in her bed as Steph and Tristan come home and start to fool around. Tessa turns over in her bed and seems lonely.The next day  Tessa walks into the campus coffee shop and orders a drink. She notices Hardin sitting on the couch reading. Hardin approaches her as she is putting sugar in her coffee. Hardin tells her it will be difficult to stay away from each other since Steph is his friend and her roommate. He says that they should start over...just be friends. Hardin says that he wants to show her something  a place. Tessa maintains that they need to keep their distance. Hardin responds by taking a step back from her making Tessa laugh. Hardin tells her he\'ll see her around and walks away disappointed. As Tessa heads for the door  she has a change of heart and decides to join him. They how them driving in his muscle car in silence stealing glances at one another. They come to a wooded area and proceed to walk to clearing with a lake. Hardin announces that this is his favorite place. He starts to take his shirt off and says that they are going swimming. Tessa seems uneasy b/c she does not have a suit. He jumps in and comments how nice the water feels. He tells her she can wear his shirt if she wants. She asks for privacy while she takes off her dress. Hardin faces away from her  sneaking a peak. He turns back around and comments that he likes his shirt better on her. He helps lower Tessa into the water  and they swim playfully. He says he enjoys the silence and they talk about he asks questions about her BF. She asks him whom he loves most in the world  and he says himself. They move closer to one another  and Tessa reminds him that they are just going to be friends. Hardin says he doesn\'t think they can only be friends. They kiss each other. They get out of the lake  and he hands her back her dress and turns around so she can put it on. They are standing back to back on the dock. Just as she is about to re-dress she slowly reaches her hand back to touch his. He turns around and starts running his hands up and down her arm & chest while breathing into her ear. He lifts her shirt up to rub her stomach and puts his fingers in her panty waistline. He can tell she is nervous. He asks if she\'s ever been touched before  she nods. He abruptly stops  and she turns around slightly annoyed asking him why he quit. He says that they\'ve got time.They next show Hardin and Tessa at a bar/grill. They receive their food and talk about Hardin not believing in love. She starts asking about his family  and he starts getting slightly defensive and upset. Tessa backs off. Just then Molly and Zed interrupt their conversation  and Hardin looks uneasy.

Molly is touching Hardin and clearly trying to get a rise out of Tessa. Hardin hands his car keys to her and tells her to wait outside. She gets up confused and says she will be standing by the bar. Hardin  Molly  and Zed stay at the table to talk. A few mins pass and Hardin joins Tessa at the bar. Tessa asks him if he was embarrassed to be seen with her. He says that\'s not the case. Tessa then says that she plans on telling Noah about the two of them. Hardin scoffs at her and tells her nothing is going on and that if she wants to break up with Noah  she should do it for herself...not him  because he doesn\'t date. Tessa is shocked and angry and slams his keys on the bar top and storms out. Hardin curses to himself knowing that he messed up.Tessa is shown going through her closet and putting on make-up.

He mentioned Tessa\'s name amid his tirade  and that\'s why Landon texted her to come over thinking she could calm him down. Tessa heads out back to the pool area where Hardin is sitting taking shots of liquor. Hardin seems surprised to see her. She tells him she thought he didn\'t drink. He says he doesn\'t or didn\'t. He says the mess he made inside was his celebration for his dad announcement that he is getting married to Landon\'s mom while his mom lives in poor conditions in London. He offers her a drink  but she refuses to say that he probably has had enough. He drops the bottle  and it shatters.

Each of them carries a huge backpack and a cellphone with an earpiece. The leader of the group  known as  Brother Bull  gives the men instructions. They break off into pairs and get into a taxi  giving different destinations such as the Victoria Terminus  the Leopold Cafe  and the Taj Mahal Palace hotel.In a nearby village  Arjun (Dev Patel) kisses his pregnant wife and small daughter goodbye as he leaves for work at the Taj. In his haste  he forgets one of his shoes. At the Taj  the staff prepares rooms and welcome guests from all over the world. Among them is Iranian-British heiress Zahra (Nazanin Boniadi)  her American husband David (Armie Hammer)  their infant son Cameron and his nanny Sally (Tilda Cobham-Hervey). In the kitchen  head chef Hemant Oberoi inspects the wait staff. He notices Arjun in sandals and tries to send him home  but after some convincing  he sends him upstairs to get an extra pair of shoes in his office. On the TV monitor  a breaking news bulletin plays about an attack at the Victoria Terminus. The two terrorists that just shot up the Victoria train station hijack a police car and continue their killing spree.Zahra and David eat dinner in the hotel\'s restaurant while Sally stays upstairs to wait for a doctor because Cameron feels slightly warm. Oberoi tells the staff to treat the couple like royalty  as well as another guest Vasili (Jason Isaacs). The Russian businessman requests a special cognac  so one of the waiters Sanjay (Gaurav Paswala) goes out to buy some. As he walks to the store  he almost hit by the taxi carrying two of the terrorists. He starts arguing with the driver as the two men leave the car.Inside the Leopold Cafe  tourist Eddie (Angus McLaren) and his girlfriend Bree (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) watch the exchange with mild amusement. They decide to head the Taj next  so they begin to pay for their meal. The waiter is suddenly shot  and a grenade is thrown into the cafe. The two men enter and begin coldly shooting people. Eddie and Bree escape and run down the streets with a huge group of people.News of the attacks is starting to reach the hotel. The staff is worried but try to remain calm in front of the guests. The group runs to the Taj and begs for sanctuary. Hotel Manager Dilip (Vipin Sharma) opens the doors  and the people rush inside. Among them are four of the terrorists (Imran  Abdullah  Houssam  Rashid). They immediately pull out guns and start massacring everyone in sight. Bree and Eddie are separated during the melee  with Bree seemingly killed when she tries to run for the exit.Arjun witnesses the carnage from the restaurant and orders the guests to hide under the tables and the staff to switch off the lights and lock the doors. David tries to call Sally  but she\'s in the shower and doesn\'t hear the phone ring. Two receptionists that are hiding under the desk  manage to call the police and warn a few guests to stay in their rooms. Once the main lobby is quiet  Brother Bull orders Imran and Rashid to begin phase two; head upstairs and execute anyone in sight.Sally finally answers her phone just as there is knocking at the door. David warns her that there are shooters in the hotel just as a woman covered in blood runs into the room  followed by the sound of gunshots. Sally grabs Cameron and hides in the bathroom closet while the woman hides in the bathroom. The two men enter the suite and kill the woman. Sally desperately tries to quiet Cameron who is starting to fuss. They manage to remain undetected  and the two men leave.Sally quickly runs into the shower  and she and the baby cry together. She calls Zahra back. David decides to sneak upstairs and get to them. He hides in the elevator behind a room service cart  and after a close call with the two terrorists  he successfully makes it to the room. Eddie jumps from the second floor window and injuries himself. As he\'s carried away  he begs for someone to save Bree  who\'s still inside.Outside the hotel  the attacks are continuing all over the city at an alarming speed. The local police aren\'t properly trained or equipped to handle an attack of this scale. Their only option is to wait for the Special Forces from New Delhi  who are about 800 miles away. Arjun\'s wife watches the news horrified. Despite being severely out-manned and unprepared  the police chief and few officers decide to enter the hotel in the hopes of reaching the CCTV room so they can track the terrorists\' movements.Since the guests\' can\'t leave through the emergency exit  Oberoi decides to move the guests trapped in the restaurant up to the Chambers Lounge  where they can hopefully hide. He gives the kitchen staff the opportunity to leave now  and while a few do  the majority decides to stay behind and help; the Taj is their home. Arjun successfully leads the guests the Lounge through the service hallway (which is hidden in the walls). Zahra texts David where they are going and asks him to meet them there.The police group enters through the main lobby. One of the terrorists throws a grenade  killing three of the officers and deafening another. The two flee into a stairwell. David  Sally  and Cameron leave the room and slowly try to reach the Lounge. Downstairs  the terrorists find the two receptionists and order them to call the people trapped in their rooms. When they refuse  they are shot. In the Lounge  a woman overhears Zahra speaking to her mother on the phone in Arabic and accuses her of being one of the terrorists. Vasili tells her to  fuck off . The same woman later complains about Arjun\'s turban (pagri) and beard. Arjun calmly explains to her that his turban is a symbol of his courage but he\'s willing to take it off it bothers her. The woman apologizes.A stewardess enters the Lounge with a few more guests. Among them is a severely wounded Bree. Realizing she needs immediate medical attention  Arjun offers to bring her outside through the back stairway. He uses his pagri to help stop the bleeding. They are met by the two policemen on the stairwell and in confusion  Bree runs through the door and is killed by Imran. Brother Bull gives him orders to start gathering hostages  particularly important looking people. David and Sally reach the sixth floor only to be confronted by Imran. David manages to shove Sally and Cameron inside a utility closet before he is taken  hostage. With no inside handle and her phone dead  she is trapped.Arjun leads the police into the CCTV room and sees many of his employees  including Sanjay  dead. Abdullah uses one of the dead officer\'s badges to try and gain access to the Lounge. Just as Oberoi is about to open the door  Arjun calls and warns him. Hearing noises inside  Abdullah starts shooting at the door. The guests and staff are ushered into the back room. The police order Arjun to stay put and attack the terrorists  successfully wounding Imran before being driven off. Upstairs with David and the hostages  Imran calls his father and tearfully tells him that he loves him.Six hours later.Zahra decides to leave the Lounge with Vasili and a few other guests  despite Oberoi\'s warnings. As they enter the lobby  the guests are killed while Vasili and Zahra are taken hostage. It is now morning  and the Indian Special Forces troops have begun to arrive. Abdullah searches through Vasili\'s pockets and discovers that he is an ex-Spetznaz Russian operative.The two terrorists who hijacked the police car are caught; one is killed  and the other is taken into custody. Brother Bull orders the group to begin their final phase: burn down the hotel. They leave Imran with the hostages. David manages to loosen his wrists and tries to attack him but is shot in the shoulder. Arjun decides to leave the CCTV to help more guests get to the Lounge. One of the guests hears Cameron crying and lets Sally out of the closet.Oberoi announces that they are going to leave through the back entrance as quickly as they can. A guest who has been on the phone with a reporter reveals where they are hiding  and this information is broadcasted on TV. Brother Bull warns the terrorists that the guests are escaping. Imran is told to execute the hostages since none of them are important enough. He shoots an American couple  David and Vasili  who tries to fight back. Zara tearfully begins reciting Salah (a Muslim prayer). Imran is unable to shoot another Muslim and spares her.The terrorists break down the Lounge doors and give chase through the stairwell  shooting a few guests and staff. As they reach the kitchen  the Special Forces troops finally enter the hotel and return fire. Arjun runs outside and tearfully embraces Oberoi as their nightmare seemingly comes to an end. Upstairs  Zahra finds the closet that Sally was hiding in. She manages to break the window and scream for help. The surviving terrorists are eventually cornered and killed. Zahra is evacuated and reunites with Sally and Cameron (Zahra\'s infant son). Arjun returns home and reunites with his own family.The closing text reveals that after three days  the Indian police killed 11 of the 12 terrorists  while capturing one. The mastermind of the plan remains at large to this day. Of the 31 people killed at the Taj Hotel  half were staff that stayed behind to help the guests. On December 21st  2008  the Taj was reopened and with Hermant Oberoi\'s help  restored to its former glory.

Ed Whittle (Thomas Middleditch) & Scott (Nyasha Hatendi) are members of his team ad Jones (John Ortiz) is his boss. William is able to imprint minds into new bodies  but they fail as the subjects refuse to accept their new synthetic bodies.After his family Mona (Alice Eve)  Matt (Emjay Anthony) & Sopihe (Emily Alyn Lind) & Zoe (Aria Leabu) is killed in a car crash  Foster uses his unique knowledge to  resurrect  them in the form of biological clones. William uses the help of Ed to map their brains and to design biological clones for their bodies (so their minds don\'t reject them). But Ed is able to get only 3 cloning pods from Biodyne\'s lab  so William has to decide whom to give up. He randomly picks Zoe and she is the one who is not cloned. Also  William deletes Zoe\'s memory from the memories of the others Mona  Matt and Sophie.\nWhen resurrecting his family  Foster does not inform them of this transition. After 17 days  the clone bodies are ready  and William is successfully able to transfer their memories into their bodies.While doing all this  William concocts a web of lies to his boss and to his friends and neighbors so as not to arouse any suspicion that his family has been missing for 17 days. William is under pressure at work to imprint another mind into a synthetic body  but William doesn\'t feel it will work. He knows that the reason imprints are failing is because the mind is rejecting a synthetic body  but it accepts a clone one. So  William decides to imprint his own neural pathways into a robotic host. He manages that by writing an algorithm that tricks the mind into accepting the synthetic host as the real body.Meanwhile Mona can feel something is not right and confronts William. William confesses the truth that she and kids died in a crash  and he brought them back. But he doesn\'t tell Mona about Zoe. But there are still references to Zoe all over the house  which William did not manage to erase despite his best efforts.This brings him into conflict with his corporate employers  who view his cloned family as property of Biodyne corporation. Jones confronts William and says he knows the truth and will confiscate the cloned subjects under Biodyne property. William decides to eradicate the algorithm so that Jones cannot misuse it.\nHe then tells Mona that Zoe was their daughter  whom he could not bring back and he had eradicated her memory.In retaliation  Jones orders the kidnapping of Mona  Sopie and Matt and forces William to come to him. Mona realizes that Ed was the one who ratted William out. Jones shoots Ed to put pressure on William to give him the algorithm. William agrees  but in the guise of designing the algorithm  he imprints his stored memory into the synthetic body and creates a robot  William.Robot William and human William will join forces to fight for freedom for William\'s cloned family. Robot William kills Jones & his goons  But Ed dies in the process. William decides to take an imprint of Jones\'s mind (Ed was shot in the head and his mind is not imprint worth). 17 days later  William has a clone of Zoe and Jones now works for William  helping old middle eastern billionaires get a chance at a second lifetime.' , 'Some Humans Are Unstoppable'

Mia (Sophie Nelisse) is pushed into the pool by mean girl Catherine (Brec Bassinger). Mia's stepsister Sasha (Corinne Foxx) doesn't help her and even denies being her sister. They are picked up by Sasha's mom Jennifer (Nia Long)  who married Mia's dad Grant (John Corbett). Sasha tells her parents none of the other girls like Mia  while the latter reiterates the former's claim that they aren't sisters.Over a meal  Grant shows Mia a shark tooth he found on one of his cave-diving expeditions  and he gives it to her  as she shares his interest in discoveries like this. Mia and Sasha are told that they are set up to go on a boat to see the sharks  which doesn't make Sasha happy since she was planning on hanging out with friends.Grant and his two assistants Ben (Davi Santos) and Carl (Khylin Rhambo) drop the girls off as they set out on another cave-diving venture nearby. The girls see that Catherine is there with her friends. Sasha's friends Alexa (Brianne Tju) and Nicole (Sistine Stallone) drive up to get Sasha out of there. She reluctantly convinces Mia to come along since she knows she would rather be anywhere than stuck with Catherine. The girls give Catherine the finger and head off.The girls arrive near a cliffside by a cave and jump in the water. Mia actually starts to have fun with Sasha and her friends. They then grab scuba gear and decide to go exploring nearby since it is in the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple. They swim through the cave and find many old carvings  as well as many skeletons. Nicole sees a blind Mexican Tetra swimming nearby. Alexa notes that it has been there a while and doesn't need eyes since it has adapted. The Tetra swims toward Nicole and frightens her when it screeches  causing her to bump into columns that causes a commotion  splitting the girls up. Mia and Alexa find each other and then come across Ben  which means Carl and Grant are not far. A shark then pops out and kills Ben  causing the girls to flee. They swim into Sasha and Nicole again  and they tell them about the shark.The shark attacks the girls  but since it is blind  it uses its hearing senses to find them. It crashes into the columns and leaves the girls trapped for a moment. Once they get free  Mia and Sasha suggest they find Grant and Carl using a guideline that will lead them to where they were working. The girls swim through catacombs and see that the line ends there. Regardless  they continue to swim forward while also minding the fact that the oxygen in their tanks is running low. The shark then pops out again  forcing them to hide behind a cage for protection. They escape by making it through a passageway too narrow for the shark to fit through. They make it into an air pocket to get oxygen back while trying to figure out their next move. Mia swims down and sees a gap that she can fit through and she goes for it.Mia swims nearby where Carl is working and listening to music. Unfortunately  he doesn't see the shark and promptly becomes its next meal. An emergency alarm then goes off as he is being shredded. Mia hears more music and finds herself alone and scared as she comes across Carl's remains. She eventually finds Grant  and the two go together to find the other girls. They are attacked by the shark again  and they fend it off using the sounds of a nearby bell  plus a blowtorch. The five reach the surface in the cave and use the alarm to scare the shark off temporarily.Grant points out a harness at the top for them to climb out of. Alexa starts to ascend first  but the sharks come to surface and Nicole panics  and jumps up to climb ahead of her. The harness starts to come loose with their combined weight  and although Nicole reaches the top  she slips and falls back down into the water before being quickly killed by two sharks.Grant and the girls then figure they need to swim to a nearby gap to get out of there  but the shark gets Grant moments later and killed  leaving Mia and Sasha devastated. They swim together with Alexa to try and get out of there. They come across a current that pulls Sasha away from Mia and Alexa. The shark finds them again and attacks Alexa  but evades it. However  she loses of oxygen tank and scuba mask  then she soon drowns.Mia finds Sasha and they end up swimming to the surface. They find a boat and try to signal it. It turns out to be the boat that they would have gotten on to see the sharks. Someone on the boat is listening to music and can't hear the girls calling  and he dumps chum into the water for the sharks. This lures a few more sharks in that direction. Mia and Sasha bang on the glass where the guests can see them  and they run to alert the crew. Mia makes it up on the boat  but Sasha gets pulled in by a shark. Mia grabs a flare gun and jumps in to save Sasha by firing the flare at the shark's face. Just as they get back  another shark grabs Mia and pulls her in. She frees herself by taking the shark tooth and slicing across the shark's side to injure it  freeing herself. The people on the boat pull Mia in before another shark can get her  (By the end  Mia and Sasha are remaining survivors after being an dreadful experience).The girls receive medical attention  but Mia and Sasha are just glad that they still have each other.  , 'The Next Chapter'  'Last Summer  the Greatest Predators Brought Our Deepest Fears to the Surface.

Frances tries to hand the bag into lost property  but nobody is there.Frances lives with her best friend and roommate Erica Penn (Maika Monroe). Frances holds onto the bag until she can return it  and Erica goes through its contents. Later  they go to a movie  but it makes Frances emotional because she used to go to the movies with her mother  who has passed away from cancer not too long ago. Her relationship with her father Chris (Colm Feore) is a bit strained as he has already moved on from his wife's death and buries himself in his work.Frances goes to Greta's home and meets her. Greta is thankful for the return of the bag  and she invites Frances inside for some coffee. Greta is a piano teacher  and she plays some music for Frances as she tells her about her family. Her husband has long since passed away  and her daughter Nicola is said to live in Paris. Sensing that Greta is lonely  Frances offers to help her find a dog for support. Greta declines but thanks Frances before she leaves  and Frances leaves Greta her phone number if she changes her mind. Sure enough  Greta calls Frances later that night to take her up on the dog  and the two go later that weekend to get an old dog named Morton.Over the next few days  Greta continues to contact Frances  and the two strike up a small friendship. Erica is suspicious of Greta and figures that Frances is only using her as a maternal substitute  but Frances is offended by that suggestion. Frances goes over to Greta's home for dinner. Frances goes to look for candles in Greta's cabinet  only to make a startling discovery: multiple identical handbags with the exact same contents inside every one of them. One has a sticky note with the number for a woman named Samantha Bales  and another has Frances's name and number. Frances becomes uncomfortable during dinner and excuses herself to leave. She goes home and tells Erica what she found.Frances attempts to get things back to normal  even though Greta continues to try and contact her. She even visits Frances at work to talk to her  but when her boss won't get rid of Greta himself  Frances confronts her about finding the other handbags and not wanting to be part of whatever crazy game Greta has planned. Frances tells Greta she never wants to see her again.Greta continues to stalk and harass Frances. She stands outside the restaurant to stare at her for hours even after the police arrive. Because Greta has not made any threats or any indication that she will attack  they cannot do anything  and the responding officer tells Frances to just ignore her.Things get worse when Frances is at home while Erica is out. Greta sends Frances pictures of Erica at her exact location  meaning Greta is stalking Erica. Frances stays on the phone with Erica until she gets somewhere safe while Frances tries to find her. Greta continues to send Frances pictures to show she is getting closer and closer to Erica  even following her onto the bus. Erica spots Greta and tells her she's sick. She runs out of the bus and manages to find the cab that Frances is in  and she joins her.

She goes by Greta's home and digs through the trash for anything she can find on her. Inside is an envelope addressed to Nicola  but not in Paris  and it was returned to the sender. Frances then makes attempts to get in touch with Nicola. After a couple of days  Frances is contacted by an officer named Alexa Hammond (Zawe Ashton)  who tells Frances that Nicola committed suicide four years earlier and had never been to France. Alexa also reaffirms that Greta is a very ill woman after Frances tells her what she heard  and adds that Greta is not French  but Hungarian.One night at the restaurant  Frances must tend to Greta  who made a reservation. Greta insists she only wants to talk  but she instead torments Frances by causing a scene. She smashes a drinking glass and then brings up Frances's mother  claiming she had to die for them to meet. Greta flips over her table and starts advancing toward Frances  who runs to the kitchen. Greta is then restrained by staff and patrons as the police arrive to take her away. However  Frances learns that Greta has been released the next day.Frances makes plans to stay with her father for safety. Erica advises Frances to finally talk to Greta and tell her she is going away for a while  as a way to slowly fade her out of her life. Greta gives her a long  unsettling hug. Later  Frances is having a drink at home when she starts to feel dizzy. Greta emerges  having drugged the drink  and she chastises Frances for supposedly lying about going away. Greta drags a drugged Frances to her home and locks her in a toy chest. Frances then wakes up  apparently having dreamed that  and finds Erica in her apartment with her. She goes to the elevator to leave  but the elevator appears to be going lower than the bottom floor  and the walls start closing in on Frances. It turns out THAT was a dream  and Frances really is locked in a toy chest. She screams to be let out  and Greta goes to do so  making it seem as a punishment for lying.Greta takes Frances's phone and makes Erica believe that Frances is on vacation with her father  while also making Chris think she is on vacation with Erica. Frances is kept hostage for an unspecified amount of time (implied to be weeks) by Greta. One afternoon  Greta is forcing Frances to help make cookies  but as she fiddles with a cookie cutter  Frances slams a rolling pin down  severing Greta's pinky finger  before Frances whacks Greta over the head with the pin. She runs to find an escape  but the doors and windows are locked. She runs to the basement and finds the body of Samantha Bales  who appears to gasp and convulse briefly before finally dying. Greta appears and suffocates Frances until she passes out. Greta then ties Frances to a bed and keeps her trapped in the wall space behind the piano.Meanwhile  Chris goes to the ladies' apartment and sees Erica. They both mention the supposed vacations  which quickly leads both of them to realize something is wrong. Chris speaks to Detective Brian Cody (Stephen Rea) to help find Frances. Cody pulls up files on Greta  revealing that she was a nurse who mistreated and possibly killed patients  and it was believed she returned to Hungary.Cody finds Greta's home and sits down for a chat. Frances hears Cody mention her name  and she tries to get his attention by banging on the bed and making the pendulum on the piano start ticking. Cody goes over to the piano  but before he can reach Frances  Greta comes running in barefoot and injects Cody with some kind of sedative. He attempts to shoot Greta  nearly hitting her  but he falls and passes out. Greta then takes his gun and kills him with the remaining bullets  and she dumps his body in a bag with a chemical quicklime and throws him in the basement.Greta then goes back to the subway to find her next victim. A young woman with curly brown hair (only viewed from the back) arrives at her home. They chat  and Greta steps away for a moment and returns to have her coffee. She then starts to feel disoriented. The woman reveals herself to be Erica  having been scouring the subways for a handbag until she found Greta. She pulls off her wig and tells Greta that she drugged her just like she did Frances. As Greta faints  Frances tries to get Erica's attention by hanging on the piano and setting off the pendulum. Erica pulls the piano back and frees Frances. The two embrace  but as Erica tries to get Frances out  they hear music playing  which means Greta is lurking. Erica steps out to find her  but as Frances steps out  she feels Greta grab her by the throat and say that she was her favorite one. Greta then passes out  and Erica prepares to bludgeon her  but Frances stops her and says she has a better idea.The two place Greta in the toy chest and keep it locked with an Eiffel Tower trinket. As the ladies leave  Greta slowly starts bumping the lid of the chest  and the trinket slowly starts moving out... implying that it won't hold Greta for long before the police can show up.  , 'Who is Greta?'

Rushing to his apartment and hastily packing  Gabriel is again confronted by Mulligan  who had him under surveillance. Gabriel evades Mulligan and hides underground.The cigarette\'s code allows Rafe\'s team to access Chicago\'s surveillance system and the deployment patterns of law enforcement units. Rafe and other Phoenix members attack the Unity Rally  using an invisible alien explosive device against the aliens when they arrive.

One day at the office  farmer Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp)  an acquaintance of Robert\'s grandmother  arrives with boxes of videotapes  requesting Robert\'s assistance. Robert doesn\'t have time for him  but later drives out to his home town of Parkersburg  West Virginia  to see his grandmother and then Wilbur. Wilbur shows him evidence - from video tapes he\'s made to remaining cow parts - of how all 190 of his cows have died  showing signs of bizarre and strange disease. He knows it has to do with the huge company DuPont  who has a plant in town  since his brother had been working for them disposing of waste. Robert asks his boss  Tom Terp (Tim Robbins) if he can take the case  assuring him it will be a small side project. Tom reluctantly agrees.At a function for attorneys  Robert broaches the subject with DuPont attorney Phil Donnelly (Victor Garber)  who politely tells him he\'s not aware of the specifics but will help out in any way he can. Mark files a small suit so he can gain information through legal discovery of the chemicals that have been dumped on the site. He doesn\'t find anything useful  then realizes it\'s possible that whatever poisoned Wilbur\'s cattle could be something that isn\'t even regulated by the EPA. At an awards dinner  he presses Phil on the issue  who curses at him and calls him a hick. Robert is able to legally force DuPont to turn over its information  which it does  sending him hundreds of boxes of documents hoping he\'ll never find anything. He goes through the files one by one  finally finding reference to a chemical called PFOA that he can\'t find anything about. He continues going through the documents.In the middle of the night  Robert\'s pregnant wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) finds him tearing the carpet off the floors and going through their pans. He tells her they\'re being poisoned  and she thinks he\'s gone mad  until he explains what he\'s found in the DuPont documents: PFOA-C8 is a man-made chemical used in the production of Teflon. It was created for army tanks  but then used by companies in American homes. DuPont has been running tests of the affect of it for decades  including on animals and on their own employees. Their own studies show that it caused cancer in animals  people  and birth defects in babies of women working on their line - and they never said a thing. They then dumped hundreds of gallons of toxic sludge upriver from Wilbur\'s farm.Wilbur  meanwhile  has been shunned by the entire local community for suing their biggest employer. His house is broken into  and he gets sicker. Robert goes to him with the evidence and tells Wilbur to take the settlement DuPont is offering  but Wilbur refuses  wanting justice and not wanting to stay silent. He tells Robert he and his wife both have cancer. Robert feels guilty  and so he gets Wilbur the settlement  he also writes a brief with all the DuPont evidence and sends it to the EPA and Department of Justice  among others. The EPA fines DuPont $16.5 million.DuPont sends a letter to Parkersburg residents telling them that there is PFOA in the water but in safe amounts. Darlene Kiger (Mare Winningham) and her husband get the letter and approach Robert  Darlene remembering her first husband\'s illness while working in the plant that the employees called  Teflon flu . She also had to have a hysterectomy before she was 40. Robert decides to start with the Kigers to lead a class action lawsuit against DuPont - he wants a settlement and also medical management for the people of Parkersburg  meaning DuPont will have to monitor and take care of their health care. There is push-back at a meeting with the partners at the law firm  who think this will ruin the firm\'s reputation to go after a company that they would normally be defending. Tom angrily chastises them  arguing that this is the right thing to do.Robert takes the class action to court in Charleston  West Virginia in order to secure medical monitoring  with local attorney Harry Dietzler (Bill Pullman)  and since PFOA isn\'t regulated  they argue that DuPont is liable because the amount in the water was higher than the one part per billion their internal documents argued to be safe. In court  DuPont claims they did a new study that says that 150 parts per billion is safe. Robert is aghast  and the locals begin protesting DuPont and the story becomes national news. DuPont agrees to settle for $70 million. Legally  they are only required to do medical monitoring if scientists prove that PFOA causes the ailments  so an independent scientific review is set up to study the affects of PFOA. If they find in favor  DuPont will have to pay up. In order to get data for it  the firm tells the locals they can get their settlement money after donating blood  and nearly 70 000 people donate to the study.Years and years go by  with no result from the study. Wilbur passes away  the Kiger family are harassed locally  and Robert faces extreme financial strain  having worked the entire case on the promise of the settlement and continuing to work on it  having to pay scientific experts. He\'s taken pay cut upon pay cut at the firm  and things are tense with Sarah. When Tom tells him he needs to take another pay cut  Robert collapses  shaking. At the hospitals  the doctors tell Sarah he had an ischemia  or minor stroke  and that he needs to get on new medication and stop dealing with so much stress. Sarah tells Tom to stop making Robert feel like a failure  since he\'s done something for people who needed help.Finally  seven years after the panel was convened  the scientific review contacts Robert and tells him that PFOA causes multiple cancers and other diseases. At dinner with his family  Rob is informed that DuPont is reneging on the entire agreement. He is angry  saying Wilbur told him that there wasn\'t any justice and he didn\'t believe him. So Rob decides to take each defendant\'s case to DuPont  one at a time.A post-script text explains that Rob won his first three multi-million dollar settlements against DuPont  and finally DuPont settles the class action for $671 million. PFOA is still in the blood of 99% of life on earth  and thousands of chemicals are still unregulated.' , 'The Truth Has a Man on the Inside'  'Based on The New York Times Expos??.'

In reality the Osiris club recognized Helloby as the  end of the world  threat to humans and wanted to kill him before he could turn on them) before they are ambushed by the giants. Barely conscious  Hellboy manages to defeat the giants before being rescued by a young woman. Hellboy awakens in the woman\'s flat and recognizes her as Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane) (who retained some magical abilities after she was kidnapped by fairies as a baby)  a medium he once rescued from fairies as a baby. Sending a SWAT team to retrieve Hellboy  Bruttenholm relays that someone has taken Nimue\'s remains and is seeking the last piece at the Osiris Club. They are introduced to M11 agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) (A rugged Japanese-American military member of the B.P.R.D. who  due to a supernatural encounter  can turn into a jaguar when angered or in pain)  and Hellboy and Alice join the team headed to the club.\nFinding everyone at the club slaughtered  Alice channels Hatton\'s spirit  who reveals that Nimue seeks Hellboy to cause the apocalypse. Nimue\'s arm is taken by Gruagach  and Nimue distracts Hellboy by appealing to his frustrations  allowing Gruagach to escape. Hellboy reveals that Gruagach is a changeling who took baby Alice\'s place before Hellboy branded him with iron. Gruagach  with the guidance of witch Baba Yaga (Emma Tate and Troy James)  revives Nimue to exact revenge on Hellboy for ruining his chance of being human.Daimio takes them to M11 headquarters before secretly acquiring a special bullet to kill Hellboy. After an argument with Bruttenholm about his adoption (Hellboy is not convinced why Bruttenholm kills every monster that walks the earth and yet decided to spare his life when he had the chance. He wants a world where monsters can live peacefully)  Hellboy leaves before being magically transported to Baba Yaga\'s house. Having shot out Baba Yaga\'s right eye  Hellboy is talked into giving up one of his eyes for the location where Nimue plans to restore herself. Hellboy reneges on the agreement  and Baba Yaga curses him. On the way to Nimue\'s location in Pendleton  Daimio reveals to Alice that he was the sole survivor of a were-jaguar attack.The group arrives after Nimue\'s full resurrection  and kills her coven with the exception of Ganeida. Nimue poisons Alice and flees with Gruagach; Ganeida directs Hellboy to the resting place of the wizard Merlin (Brian Gleeson) to save Alice. Hellboy and Daimio excavate Merlin\'s still-living body  and Merlin cures Alice before putting her and Daimio to sleep. Merlin tells Hellboy that he is descendant of King Arthur through his mother who was spirited to Hell by his father. When offered Excalibur  Hellboy refuses it after a vision of himself causing the apocalypse. Merlin  having exhausted his magic  disintegrates.The trio return to London to find the M11 staff dead and Bruttenholm missing. They follow Nimue to St Paul\'s Cathedral  and Hellboy fights an empowered Gruagach aided by Daimio in were-jaguar form. Nimue kills Gruagach  and knocks Hellboy into Arthur\'s hidden tomb that holds Excalibur. Hellboy initially refuses to pull the sword  but reneges when Nimue kills Bruttenholm. The sword\'s removal opens a portal to Hell from which demons emerge and attack London. Alice channels Bruttenholm\'s spirit to dissuade Hellboy and he decapitates Nimue  throwing her head into the closing portal after the demons are sent back to hell. Hellboy and Bruttenholm exchange farewells  and Daimio discards the special bullet.Six months later  the trio raid a cult club where they find the water tank of an Ichthyo sapiens. In a mid-credits scene  Hellboy is consoled at Bruttenholm\'s grave by the ghost of his hero Lobster Johnson (Thomas Haden Church). In a post-credits scene  Baba Yaga enlists an unseen force to seek out Hellboy with the promise of allowing him to finally die.' , 'Demons Have Demons Too.'

Chambers was a TV star before becoming President and now wants to transition into a career in the movies.\nSeeing an opportunity  she convinces him to endorse her as a potential presidential candidate. Charlotte is a Rhodes scholar and a Pulitzer winner. She is the youngest Secretary of State in US history. Charlotte works extremely hard and barely had any time for a personal life.Katherine (Lisa Kudrow) is the head of Field\'s polling team. Katherine asks Charlotte to hire a funny speech writer to get her scores up  and to pick an issue that people care about. Katherine also proposes a high-profile political hook-up (like dating the Canadian PM James Steward (Alexander Skarsgard)) for Charlotte to create a media buzz and more publicity.Meanwhile  New York City journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) learns that the newspaper he works for has been bought by Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis)  a wealthy media mogul whose ethics directly oppose Fred\'s. Fred is an undercover investigative journalist that specializes in producing stories that expose the lies of big media and exposes hate groups such as white supremacists  anti-Semitics and so on.\nSo  to be bought out by big media is ironic!! Furious  he promptly quits but cannot find another job.Depressed  he turns to his more successful best friend Lance (O\'Shea Jackson Jr.)  who takes him to a charity fund-raising event that Charlotte is also attending. She and Fred recognize each other  as she was his babysitter (She was 16  and he was 13 back then) and secret love interest when they were teenagers. While they catch up  Wembley interrupts them to plan a meeting with Charlotte  leading Fred to condemn Wembley\'s actions (Fred tells Wembley that he represents what is wrong with the USA) and beliefs before leaving.Upon reading some of Fred\'s columns  Charlotte decides to hire him to write her speeches over the protests of her manager Maggie (June Diane Raphael). Maggie says that Fred looks like a homeless hobo.\nCharlotte wants Fred to write her speech for her upcoming visit to King Gustav of the Swedish Royal family. Charlotte wants to use the visit to announce a comprehensive environmental deal with the world\'s 3 largest polluters  calling it the Global Rehabilitation Initiative. With this initiative as a springboard  she will announce her run for the Presidency. Despite voicing skepticism of her ethics  Fred takes the job. Fred is not sure if Charlotte\'s initiative is real  or just talk  as he believes that most environmental initiatives are watered down eventually.At a world leaders\' summit  Charlotte is forced to revise a speech involving a planned environmental revision to appease some of her constituents. When Fred objects and calls her out on abandoning her morals  she changes her mind  and the speech is a success.As the two continue to spend time together under the pretext of Fred learning more about Charlotte for his writing  they start to get close. Charlotte is on a 20-nation tour to garner more support for her environmental initiative  and this gives her time to bond with Fred. Finally  after surviving a revolution in Manila (where they are rescued by the secret service and locked into a basement warehouse for safety)  they begin a relationship together when they are evacuated to a secluded Island for safety.Upon finding out  Maggie tries to warn both that the public will never accept them as a couple. Maggie says that Charlotte belongs with someone like James Steward.\nWhen Chambers orders Charlotte to remove plans to preserve the trees  as some friends of his asked  she lets off steam with Fred by getting high on ecstasy. A hostage crisis occurs (when a US U-2 spy plane goes down in the country of Kashtari and the pilot is taken hostage by their military) soon after and  despite still being high  Charlotte manages to talk the captors down and free the hostage.Even though the incident increases Charlotte\'s approval rating  Chambers is livid when she chooses to ignore his orders and call him out. He confronts her in his office alongside Wembley  who has a vested interest in removing the trees as part of her plan. Wembley wants to build a server farm in Alaska by clearing the land of trees  which would not be possible now.\nThe two blackmail her with a hacked video from Fred\'s webcam of him discussing their relationship and masturbating to a video of one of her speeches.\nShe shows Fred the video and informs him that she has agreed to the ultimatum  and that she wants to introduce him and their relationship publicly once his image is cleaned up. Disappointed and unable to change  Fred refuses  and they break up.Back in New York  Fred talks with Lance  who tells him that he has been too stubborn with his principles and refusal to consider other people\'s needs and opinions. Fred decides to accede to Charlotte\'s ideas.\nDuring her announcement to run for president in 2020  Charlotte changes her mind and opts for her original plan  also revealing the blackmail from Wembley and Chambers and describing the content of the video before its release. The video is released and Fred is nicknamed  cum guy  by the news media.Fred searches for Charlotte and finds her waiting at his apartment. They admit that they love each other and meet the press outside where Charlotte introduces Fred as her boyfriend. In 2021  the couple marry  and Charlotte is sworn in as the first female president with Fred as  First Mister   him having taken her last name.' , 'Unlikely but not impossible.'

Nearby  horror fan Stella Nicholls (Zoe Coletti) is called by her friends Chuck Steinberg (Austin Zajur) and Auggie Hilderbrandt (Gabriel Rush) to play a prank on school bully Tommy Milner (Austin Abrams). The jock and his buddies are throwing beer bottles at a neighborhood scarecrow called Harold (Mark Steger). Tommy also takes a swing at Harold with his bat.Chuck fishes poop out of the toilet and meets with his friends to throw it  plus eggs and toilet paper  at Tommy\'s car while he is out with Chuck\'s sister Ruthie (Natalie Ganzhorn) and his buddies. Tommy ends up driving his car back into a fence. He and his friends chase after the kids  who run to a drive-in theater and hide in Ramon\'s car. The bullies find them and threaten them into getting out  including Ramon. However  they are driven out of there by security  but not before Tommy makes a snide comment to Stella about her mom walking out on her and her father. After the jerks leave  Stella takes a breath outside before inviting Ramon to join her and the guys into checking out a haunted house.The four go to the home of Sarah Bellows  a figure in an old legend about a disturbed woman who allegedly poisoned numerous children in the neighborhood. The kids enter after Ramon picks the locks on the door. Auggie and Chuck mess around to scare each other  but Chuck ends up hiding in a closet where he sees the old room turn refurbished  and what appears to be an old woman with a dog sitting by the bed. Auggie opens the door to scare Chuck  and everything looks old again. Meanwhile  Stella and Ramon find Sarah\'s old book of scary stories. They are then trapped down there by Tommy and his goons. Ruth tells Tommy to let them out  but he locks her in there too. After trying to break out  an unseen force lets them free. They go outside to find that Ramon\'s car was vandalized by Tommy  with  wetback  written on it. Ramon must take it to the shop  and since he was living in his car  he has nowhere to go. Stella invites him to come over and stay in the basement.Tommy drives home drunk and is ordered by his mother to deliver eggs to the neighbors. On his way  he comes across Harold and taunts him again. At the same time  Stella reads from Sarah\'s book and sees the story  Harold  appearing. As she reads it  she notices that it mentions Tommy. He ends up walking in a circle and sees that Harold is no longer on his pike. Tommy soon realizes he is being followed by Harold. He trips across a rake and uses it to try and stop Harold  but the scarecrow takes it from him and impales Tommy with it. As Tommy tries running away  his body starts to fill up with straw.In the morning  Ramon brings his car to the shop  but he is pressed by Chief Turner (Gil Bellows) over his appearance in town. When he sees what Tommy wrote  Turner questions him over the supposed fight he got into with him. Ramon mentions his last name being Rodriguez  and Turner implies he will investigate him.Tommy is noted as being missing by Stella\'s father Roy (Dean Norris). She goes to investigate with Ramon  and they find what appears to be Harold wearing Tommy\'s clothes. Stella figures that this is Tommy and that the story she read came to life. She decides to take the book back to the Bellows house to prevent it from continuing.When Stella returns home with Ramon  he finds Sarah\'s book back on Stella\'s bookshelf. A new story then begins to appear   The Big Toe . This one features Auggie\'s name  and it involves him eating a stew containing an appendage  and a disembodied voice calling out  WHO TOOK MY TOE?  Stella calls Auggie to warn him  but he ends up eating the stew  and the Big Toe woman (Javier Botet) starts stalking him. Auggie runs to hide in his room under his bed  but as he thinks he is safe  Big Toe pulls him under the bed and reveals her hideous face before making him disappear. Stella and Ramon show up too late and see the claw marks under Auggie\'s bed to have their fears confirmed.Stella tells Chuck and Ruth that Auggie is gone and that it\'s because of the book. Chuck suggests they take it to the police  but Ramon doesn\'t want to get involved with them since they might think he had something to do with both Auggie and Tommy disappearing  as there is now a search party going out for the latter. The trio try to burn the book  but it doesn\'t work.The friends go to the Mill Valley Gazette to dig up any old information on Sarah. They find articles about a woman named Lulu Baptiste  who worked for the Bellows family but was fired after Sarah hung herself  and it was believed that Lulu was teaching Sarah black magic. The book then starts to write another story   The Red Spot . This one is about Ruthie  who got bitten by a spider while trapped in the Bellows house. She is set to go on stage for a performance of  Bye Bye Birdie   but the spider bite on her cheek starts to get worse. She goes to the bathroom to check on it  and hears a voice calling her name. A spider leg then pokes out of Ruth\'s cheek  before a whole swarm of spiders start crawling out and biting her. Stella  Chuck  and Ramon run to the school in time to catch Ruth and throw water on her to repel the spiders. She is covered in bites and crying to get the spiders off. She is later taken to the hospital.The friends track down the now elderly and blind Lulu (Lorraine Toussaint) to ask what happened with her and Sarah  hoping to find a way to undo what has been going on. She says there was no magic involved  but the presence of the book overwhelms Lulu.The trio then heads to a hospital that they think has records of the Bellows family. Chuck mentions having a dream about seeing a pale woman in a red room  telling him   This is an evil place. Run while you still can.  The kids sneak in and head to find whatever documents they can. Stella and Ramon come across a room with old recordings from Sarah as she received electroshock treatment from her brother Ephraim. They hear the voice of Sarah (Kathleen Pollard)  who  as it turns out  was innocent and never poisoned the children  but it was her family\'s fault for tainting the water supply  and they tortured her and framed her to cover up their secrets. She then appears to be reciting the new story being written   The Dream.  Orderlies find Chuck as he snuck in  and the alarm goes off  making everything go red. He then sees the Pale Lady (also Mark Steger)  who appears grotesquely overweight and has a horrifying grin etched on her face. No matter where Chuck runs  the Pale Lady keeps coming closer and closer until he cannot escape and she absorbs Chuck. Stella and Ramon find out too late that he is gone  and they are kicked out of the hospital.Stella calls her father from the precinct. She fears that she is going to die because of the book  and she tells him not to think that she is running away. Roy tells her to not think that it was ever her fault that her mother left. Turner then interrogates Stella and Ramon about the disappearances of their friends. They try to explain that it\'s because of the book  but it is too far-fetched for Turner to believe. He also brings up that Ramon\'s real last name is Morales and that he dodged the draft. The two are placed in adjacent cells  and Ramon explains that his brother was drafted to Vietnam and was killed out there  so he got away after learning he was to be drafted. Soon  the next story is being written  and a monster called the Jangly Man (Troy James) emerges. He breaks Turner\'s neck and tosses his body toward Stella\'s cell. She gets the keys  but the Jangly Man attempts to get Ramon since his name was in the book  and he knows of the Jangly man from an old story his father told him. Stella frees them both from the cell  and they realize they must run to the Bellows house to put an end to this. Jangly Man chases after them as they take Turner\'s car  but Ramon manages to lose him by crashing the car and pinning Jangly Man to a train.Stella and Ramon run to the Bellows house  where they get separated as Jangly Man goes for Ramon. Stella is pulled into another room by the ghosts of the Bellows family. She comes face-to-face with Sarah\'s ghost  who is getting ready to trap Stella in her own story. However  Stella hears Ramon\'s voice telling her to tell Sarah the truth. Stella stands up to the ghost and says that she knows that her family killed the children and framed her  but she is becoming as big of a monster as they were by haunting and taking her friends. Stella promises Sarah that she will tell the truth about her. Sarah gives Stella a quill and tells her to write Sarah\'s story in her own blood. Stella writes the truth  and Sarah\'s ghost wails before crossing over. The Jangly Man goes down as the terror appears to stop. Stella and Ramon run to embrace each other.Later on  Ramon willingly goes to be drafted in Vietnam. He says farewell to Stella  who gives him a letter and promises to write to him. He reads it on the bus  and it\'s a letter from her asking him to come home soon.Stella writes a story in the school paper about the truth over the Bellows family history. While not many people are listening  she is determined to let the real story be known.

Kai pressures the staff to come up with more lists involving trending topics that generate lots of hits such as pizza and cute animals. Phil is a writer in the list department  but he really would rather work in the real news department since that\'s what he has a degree in.

After work  Phil\'s coworkers  Craig and Elaine (Ron Funches and Charlyne Yi) invite him to come to play kickball with them after work  but being socially inept  Phil feigns that he has a busy schedule and declines the invitation.When he checks his iPhone  we see that he has nothing scheduled.

She pretends to be Phil and emails an insulting letter to Kai  calling him a virgin and demanding the promotion.When Phil gets to work  Kai demotes him to the  Comment section   which happens to be where the older employees at the company work in a dark basement. Craig and Elaine come down to the basement and invite Phil to play kickball again  and he declines  but Jexi puts him on blast as having nothing to do except  masturbate furiously and cry himself to sleep.  Phil embarrassingly agrees to come along and is disastrously wrong  which costs the team the game. Phil invites everyone out for drinks  but they turn him down. Back at home  Phil thinks about Cate and looks up the bike shop where she told him she works. Jexi thinks Phil is stalking Cate and that it\'s weird  so she dials the bike shop against Phil\'s protests and moves the end call button around the screen so that he can\'t hang up. After an awkward moment of silence  Phil talks to her and stumbles through the conversation  which elicits sympathy from Jexi.The next morning  Phil sees Cate when they stop at the same coffee shop  and she ends up giving her phone number to him  which turns everything around  and they end up setting up a date. When Phil goes to play kickball that day with his coworkers  he is a stud and is making ridiculous plays  and they win. He also bonds with his coworkers over being fans of Days of Thunder fans. That night Phil talks to Jexi and thanks to her for helping him make changes in his life. When Phil goes on his date  it goes south as Phil starts asking weird questions that draw hilarious responses from Jexi. Cate says that Phil is paying more attention to his phone than to Cate  and Phil decides to be honest about liking Cate a lot.Cate decides since she got dressed up  she might as well stay on the date  and they go biking instead until Phil crashes off his bike and ruins it. After he and Cate part ways  he decides he argues with Jexi and then decides to throw her away but changes his mind when he can\'t remember how to get home. Later Cate comes up with the idea that she and Phil should go to the Kid Cudi concert  and she sends him a cleavage pic to entice him into it. Phil thinks the proper response is sending a dick pic despite Jexi\'s advising him not to  and she refuses to allow him to send any of the multiple ones he took. We then see the phone screen  and Cate has sent a message to Phil thanking him for not sending a dick pic since she thinks that it\'s gross.When Phil gets to work the next day  one of the real news employees suffered a freak accident thanks to some app on his phone  and Kai promotes Phil  and he moves into the office space. When it\'s time to go to the concert  Cate insists Phil leave his phone at home  which makes Jexi jealous. Cate and Phil sneak into the concert and sneak backstage where they meet Kid Cudi and party with him.That night  they end up having sex. When Phil gets home  Jexi is mad and decides to ruin Phil\'s life.At work that day  Phil gets fired after Jexi sends a mass dick pic text to the entire company  so he decides to get a replacement phone again. He gets home to set up the new phone  and Jexi has followed him to the new device because she\'s in the cloud. When Phil goes to see Cate at the bike shop  her ex-fiancee she told him about earlier in the film has come back into town coincidentally  and he looks better than he did before. Things look like Cate might get back together with him  so Phil breaks off his relationship with Cate for fear of being hurt.Phil and Jexi bond again  and Phil becomes a slob who is heavily reliant on his phone again. Jexi then lets it slip that Cate\'s ex is at a hotel  and Phil deduces that Jexi set the two of them up to separate Phil and Cate  so he storms out of the apartment  leaving the phone inside. Jexi follows him in the streets from car to radio to electronic sign and eventually crashes a car into the phone store Phil got her from.When Phil arrives at the hotel  he apologizes to Cate and ends up punching her ex  who tries to interrupt him to tell Phil that he\'s leaving  and Cate isn\'t accompanying him to Brazil as he thought. Cate and Phil end up back together  and Jexi and Phil make up as well  and she tells him she\'s proud of him and happy for him and calls Phil her friend.The movie ends with Kai meeting Jexi through his phone and making him do his dance while we see Jexi putting Kai through similar things that she put Phil through.' , 'She had him at  hello '

Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokama) following a dinner with the Japanese navy. Yamamoto tells Layton how Japan is eager to become a world power on the same level as the U.S. and China  but the U.S. only sends a limited amount of oil. He promises to Layton that if their supplies are compromised  the Japanese will be forced to take drastic measures.Four years later on December 7  1941  World War II is raging on  with Japan having invaded China and Hitler taking over Europe. The U.S. has remained neutral up until this point. Just over a thousand miles of Pearl Harbor  pilot Dick Best (Ed Skrein) is flying during a routine exercise with other pilots  ending with a rocky landing aboard the USS Enterprise. He must stay behind and work with his superior officer  Wade McClusky (Luke Evans).On the USS Arizona  Lt. Roy Pearce (Alexander Ludwig) is setting up for church with the rookies. Moments later  Japanese airships fly in and begin to fire upon Pearl Harbor. Ships are bombed and pilots are shot out of the sky. Best\'s wife Ann (Mandy Moore) and daughter Barbara (Madison Roukema) notice the attack from their backyard. Layton is alerted to the attack and joins his fellow officers. Pearce helps the young men move across to a safer boat while he stays behind and tries to fight back. McClusky gathers his men to prepare themselves for battle  now that the U.S. is officially part of WWII. Just then the Arizona explodes from several hits by Japanese planes  killing nearly everyone on board.After the attack is over  bodies are recovered from the water. Best goes to identify Pearce\'s body  as he was his roommate and old friend. With Pearce\'s body burnt beyond recognition  Best can only identify him with a class ring. Later  Best joins his fellow soldiers at a bar to toast to Pearce\'s memory. Meanwhile  Layton reports to Admiral Kimmel that while the attack did serious damage  it could have been worse. Namely  the base\'s fuel oil storage facilities were untouched: had they been attacked and destroyed  that loss could have crippled the US Pacific fleet by itself by eliminating its main refuelling facility in the middle of Pacific Ocean and forced to its retreat to the West Coast of the United States.In Japan  Yamamoto becomes aware that the attack has provoked the U.S. He meets with Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano)  having hoped that Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimara) would destroy the U.S. oil tank farms    but the men proceed to work on their next move  which is to go after the U.S. air carriers.Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) arrives in Washington to be assigned as the new commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet  which took a major hit with the Pearl Harbor attack. He later meets Layton  discussing the latter\'s failure to warn his superiors in time prior to the attack. Nimitz is firm that he will help lead the men in their next fight  starting by sending them to invade the Marshall Islands.McClusky\'s men fly into the Islands  while William  Bull  Halsey\'s (Dennis Quaid) men take on the Japanese from the seas. A fight ensues  with U.S. pilots firing upon Japanese ships. A machinist named Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas) manages to successfully shoot down a Japanese plane into the ocean  which gets him promoted by Halsey.Later on  Lt. Colonel James Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart) arrives as the men are heading to Japan to provide bomber planes with the intent of striking Tokyo. They begin their air raids across Japan. Doolittle ends up in Japanese-occupied territory in China. After some convincing that he is an American military pilot  the Chinese civilians and guerillas congratulate him for striking a blow against Japan. Japanese planes fire upon the village where Doolittle is  killing a number of civilians. Meanwhile  Admiral Yamamoto is despondent at allowing such a brazen attack  but his spirits are lifted upon learning that the incident has convinced the alarmed Japanese government to agree to his plan to take Midway.Layton informs Nimitz that crypt-analyst Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) has picked up a message that indicates the Japanese are moving toward the Coral Sea  targeting something referred to as  AF . The Americans make their move in that direction as well. Halsey promotes McClusky to lead the pilots while Best is promoted to skipper. Layton thinks that  contrary to Washington\'s belief on the Japanese are targeting a location in the South Pacific  Layton thinks  AF  is code for Midway  and they are planning to attack there in a matter of weeks. Layton brings Nimitz to personally meet with Rochefort to back up their claims. Nimitz orders them to try and convince Washington with this information. To do  Layton secretly arranges the Midway base to broadcast an uncoded radio message saying their water treatment systems have malfunctioned. Sure enough  Layton\'s codebreakers intercept a Japanese coded message saying AF is having water problems  and Layton cheerfully passes that clear confirmation of Japan\'s target to Nimitz.Best begins training the rookies to fly. As it happens  the conditions for takeoffs from the carrier prove dangerously poor and he is barely able to ascend into the air. Unfortunately  Best\'s warning to abort more sorties until the carrier is repositioned come too late and another pilot lands in the water  getting killed when the ship sails over the plane despite the helm\'s best efforts to avoid it. Best expresses his woes and doubts to Ann later that night.Nimitz orders USS Hornet and Enterprise out of the Coral Sea and demands that Yorktown  which has been greatly damaged  be readied for the battle within 72 hours. The men continue to prepare and train themselves  all while dreading the battle that lies ahead. However  the arrival of the USS Yorktown lifts their spirits for the action ahead.On the morning of June 4  1942 the Japanese launch their air attack on Midway. Director John Ford (Geoffrey Blake) runs around the scene with his crew to get some great footage for his next project despite the weapons fire around him. The Americans swoop in the join the battle. McClusky orders his men to follow the Japanese as their destroyer makes its way back to the main fleet for reinforcements. The U.S. launch a torpedo at a Japanese battleship  but they miss. Meanwhile  Nagumo and Yamaguchi plot to launch another strike against the air carriers. The pilots proceed to bomb the Japanese battleships  severely wiping out their attache. In the middle of the battle  Gaido and another soldier are found by the Japanese in the ocean and are brought on-board. After Gaido insults them  he is thrown overboard and sunk with an anchor.The Japanese retaliate and destroy Yorktown. Best is informed that his squadron has lost many men and that one Japanese carrier remains  so he rounds up all the men he can to head out and destroy it  which is successfully done. Following the loss of their carriers  Admiral Yamamoto  painfully aware that the Americans had been apparently been aware of their plans and expecting them all this time  orders his fleet to retreat rather than risk more casualties. Washington learns of the Japanese surrender  and they celebrate their victory. Yamaguchi and Nagumo stay behind and go down with their ship as it is bombed.The soldiers return home from their battle. Best  after giving his thanks to Layton for his superb intelligence work that helped make that victory possible  reunites with Ann  informing her that he may not fly again since the doctors told him he inhaled caustic fumes. She is just happy that he is home  safe and sound.There are numerous texts regarding the fates of the American and Japanese men involved  as well as acknowledging that 250 000 Chinese were murdered by the Japanese army for helping the Doolittle Raiders escape  as well as a dedication to all those that gave their lives.' , 'Based on real events.'

The next morning  Harlan\'s housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds him dead  apparently having slit his own throat. An anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to investigate.Blanc learns that Harlan had alienated much of his family: he had threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard (Don Johnson) (Harlan\'s son-in-law and Linda\'s husband  who helps run his wife\'s company) for having an affair; cut off his daughter-in-law Joni\'s (Toni Collette) (widow of Harlan\'s deceased son Neil  who is a lifestyle guru and influencing person) allowance for stealing money meant for her daughter\'s tuition; fired his youngest son Walt (Michael Shannon) (Harlan\'s youngest son  Donna\'s husband  and the CEO of his father\'s publishing company) from his publishing company; and cut his lazy grandson Ransom (Chris Evans) (Harlan\'s grandson  Linda and Richard\'s son  and a spoiled playboy) out of his will.\nNobody in the family respects Walt  although he is proud to call himself a  self-made man .Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis) (Harlan\'s eldest daughter and Richard\'s wife. She is a real estate mogul who runs her own company with her husband\'s support). Megan  Meg  Thrombey (Katherine Langford) (Harlan\'s granddaughter  Joni and Neil\'s daughter  who studies at a prestigious liberal arts college). Jacob Thrombey (Jaeden Martell) (Harlan\'s grandson  Walt and Donna\'s son  who holds alt-right views and is always on his phone). Donna Thrombey (Riki Lindhome) (Harlan\'s daughter-in-law and Walt\'s wife). Wanetta  Great Nana  Thrombey (K Callan) (Harlan\'s elderly mother)Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) (a local detective involved in the investigation) & Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan) (a police officer involved with the investigation) are conducting the initial investigation and the family is upset as it is a suicide case.Unknown to Blanc  after the party Harlan\'s nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana De Armas) (Harlan\'s nurse and caretaker who had a close relationship with him)  giving Harlan his daily medications  had a fatal mix-up between similar-looking bottles of Ketorolac and morphine. Recognizing that he was likely minutes from death from an overdose  Harlan told Marta how to avoid suspicion by making it appear he was still alive after she had driven home  and then slit his own throat to save her from any suspicion.Basically  Harlan asked Marta to leave publicly and then come back through climbing a side pipe. Then he made her dress like himself and go downstairs where Walter saw her and acknowledged her as Harlan. She then goes back up and leaves through the same pipe route that she came in. Carrying out Harlan\'s instructions  Marta was seen escaping the house by Harlan\'s very elderly mother  who mistook her for Ransom.Marta cannot lie without vomiting  so she gives technically true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property  Marta attempts to conceal evidence (She uses a magnet to erase the security tapes  she steps over her foot-marks in the mud from where she re-entered the house at night). The family is shocked to learn from Harlan\'s lawyer that Harlan left everything to Marta. They turn on her  but Ransom helps her escape. At a restaurant  Ransom tricks Marta into confessing to him  and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys realize that  under the slayer rule  Marta will lose the inheritance if she is found guilty of killing Harlan  but Blanc tells them that they all are still suspects. They try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance.Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan\'s toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner\'s office  but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. When Blanc spots her and Ransom  Marta speeds away. The police catch them and arrest Ransom. Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan\'s mother had seen Ransom climbing down from Harlan\'s upstairs rooms on the night of his death.Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged. She performs CPR and calls 911. Marta confesses everything to Blanc  but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house  Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran\'s cannabis stash. Marta is about to confess to the family  but Blanc interrupts her after reading the report. He brings Marta  Ransom and the police to a room to reveal his deduction.After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta  he swapped the contents of Marta\'s medication vials so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine  making her ineligible to claim his inheritance. However  Marta  an experienced nurse  administered the correct medicine without reading the labels  and is thus innocent of Harlan\'s death. After the death was reported as suicide  Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta\'s guilt. Fran later saw Ransom swapping the vials back and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had given Harlan the correct medication  Ransom passed on the blackmail note to Marta  removing the address and time. He destroyed the evidence of Marta\'s innocence by burning down the medical examiner\'s office and burning Fran\'s copy of the toxicology report. He drugged Fran with morphine and emailed her location to Marta  planning to frame Marta for Fran\'s murder.Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive. Believing that Fran will implicate him  Ransom angrily confesses and vows revenge. However  Marta vomits on Ransom; she lied that Fran had survived in order to trick Ransom into confessing. He attacks her with a knife  but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. As Ransom is taken into custody  Marta watches the Thrombeys from what is now her mansion.' , 'Everyone has a motive.

The story interweaves the stories of three different women who work at Fox News.Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron)  one of the network\'s biggest stars  prepares to moderate a debate of the Republican candidates for president. Despite some push-back from colleagues  she is determined to ask Trump about his sexist comments towards women. The day of the debate  she gets extremely sick  vomiting in the bathroom. She goes on anyway and asks him about his comments. He spends the evening tweeting viciously about her  inciting his followers to attack her as well. Megyn is distressed at the amount of hate she receives and about the fact that she has become the story instead of reporting it.During her time off  she gets rude comments made to her and a paparazzo appears outside her window  taking pictures of her daughter  forcing her husband Douglas (Mark Duplass) to get rid of him. When she returns to work  while Fox hires a security detail  the network is not going to come out against Trump. Roger  who is close with Megyn  is notoriously paranoid  and believes that Megyn was poisoned the day of the debate.Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman)  was the co-host of Fox and Friends  but was removed from that spot and given a less valuable afternoon one. After enduring sexist comment after sexist comment (often on the air)  she is tired of it. She meets with attorneys who tell her that her contract makes it tough for her to fight back in any way - they tell her the story of Rudi Bakhitar (Nazanin Boniadi) who was fired after not accepting her boss\'s sexual advances. They tell her the workaround would be to sue Roger directly  but she\'d need to have hard evidence  and other women would need to come forward - Gretchen is certain other women will  and returns to work.Kayla Popisil (Margot Robbie) is a young conservative woman raised in a religious home who worships the right-wing and conservative Fox News network. She has begun her career there working under Gretchen  until she is offered a promotion to Bill O\'Reilly\'s show  the network\'s biggest program. On one of her shows  Gretchen wears no makeup to show and support women  and Roger storms down to the studio and makes a vicious comment about her appearance  which Kayla hears. She then tells Gretchen she\'s leaving - Gretchen wants her to stay  and tells her she can protect her  but Kayla doesn\'t see why she should turn down a promotion. She moves to O\'Reilly and gets chewed out by him during her first day. Kayla\'s co-worker  Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon)  helps her out by showing her how to make Fox News stories   terrify your grandmother  outrage your grandfather. One day after a round of work drinks  Kayla and Jess sleep together  though Kayla tells Jess she isn\'t a lesbian. She is shocked to find a Hilary poster in Jess\'s apartment  and wants to know why a gay Hilary supporter works at Fox. Jess explains she applied to many jobs but this was the one that stuck  and now no one else will hire her because she works at Fox.At work  Kayla tells Jess to hide a photo she has with another woman. Kayla is invited to Roger\'s office to meet with him  and she\'s excited at the idea of being promoted to on air talent. She tells him this  and he asks her to get up and do a twirl for him. He then asks to see more of her legs. He keeps doing this until she  extremely uncomfortable  pulls her skirt up high enough that he can see her underwear. He dismisses her  and she tries to tell Jess about it  but Jess sadly tells her she can\'t be involved.Time passes  and Megyn goes to interview Donald Trump at Trump Tower. When she reviews the footage  Douglas is angry that it seems like she let him off the hook with barely a slap on the wrist. Meanwhile  Gretchen does a story on her show where she tells the audience that she supports a ban an assault weapons  and is asked to come to the second floor. All three women end up in the elevator at the same time  as Kayla is sent up to Roger\'s office  and Gretchen meets with executives who fire her. She wants to know why  but isn\'t given a reason. Gretchen files suit against Roger  which sends the Fox offices into high alert. Roger meets with his wife Beth (Connie Britton)  attorney Susan Estrich (Allison Janney)  and Rudy Giuliani (Richard Kind)  and denies all the claims.Fox tells all of their female talent to come out and support Roger  which many of them do happily  saying they were never harassed. Megyn is silent  and she tells her staff the truth - because Roger harassed her when she began at the network. Her second-in-command  Gil (Rob Delaney) wants to know what she wants to do - she tells him she just spent all that time being the news  and she doesn\'t want to insert herself into this just yet. Fox  however  keeps pressuring Megyn to make a statement in support of Roger.In the initial aftermath of the suit  not one other woman comes forward  deeply disappointing Gretchen  who had really believed other women would speak out. Investigators do find six women who were horrifically sexually harassed by Roger  but before Fox News  which isn\'t helpful to Gretchen\'s suit or public perception. Megyn considers coming forward  but does not want to be the only one  and begins hunting for the other women  despite the danger of doing so at Fox.She eventually follows a few leads herself and finds multiple women who have been harassed or assaulted by Roger  Bill O\'Reilly  and other men at the network and convinces them to go to the investigators. She meets with Kayla  who she is asks if Roger harassed her. Kayla admits he did  and Megyn tells her it happened to her. Kayla is angry  wanting to know why she did nothing to protect women after her and why she isn\'t doing anything now. Megyn tells Kayla it isn\'t her job to protect her and to report the harassment.While on a date with a man  Kayla calls Jess  crying  asking if she gave Megyn her name. Jess tells her she was worried about her  and Kayla tells her through tears that she gave into Roger. Jess is sorry  and when Kayla tells her she thinks she wants to go to the investigators  she encourages her to do so. Megyn finally comes forward  which is a massive nail in Roger\'s coffin. When she is interviewed by the investigators  she sees her name is  Witness W   and realizes that 23 women have come forward. Susan tells Roger that Gretchen recorded all of their meetings  and has proof of everything in the suit. He asks why they didn\'t say anything before  and Susan tells Roger they wanted him to deny everything only to prove he was lying.Roger meets with Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell)  his longtime friend and owner of Fox News  and the term\'s of Roger\'s exit are settled. Roger asks to go to the newsroom to tell everyone  but Rupert says no. Megyn is at the Republican National Convention when she is informed that Roger is out. Kayla  happy that Roger is gone  takes Jess\'s photo out of her drawer and encourages her to keep it out - Jess hides it anyway once Murdoch enters the newsroom where he gives a speech to them them that Roger is gone and he will be taking over. Kayla  realizing she is done with Fox News  walks out  tossing her badge into the trash as Jess watches her go  happy for her.Gretchen gets a settlement offer of twenty million dollars and an apology from Fox News  which she can\'t believe she got. She tells the audience she doesn\'t care if they like her  she just cares that they believe her. Her attorneys tell her that along with the settlement comes a non-disclosure  which means she can never tell her story.

She runs toward the road and gets a woman to stop and help her  and she sees that Margaret\'s right hand has been severed.Meanwhile in Pennsylvania  a couple named John (Peter Mooney) and Sarah Bloom (Taylor Schilling) are heading to the hospital for the arrival of their baby. As Sarah goes into labor  police in Ohio arrive outside the home of Edward Scarka (Paul Fauteux)  the man who captured Margaret. He walks outside nude to surrender with something behind his back as the officers have their guns drawn on him. Scarka raises his hand and is gunned down. They see that he is holding Margaret\'s hand. Moments after Scarka dies  the Blooms\' son Miles is born with blood in the same places where Scarka was shot.Over time  Miles turns out to be an oddly calm child. He doesn\'t cry when getting shots (or just doesn\'t cry ever)  but also demonstrates unsettling behavior  like grabbing a spider just to crush it  and then speaking Hungarian in his sleep. Sarah also notes to her friend that Miles has heterochromia (two different eye colors).Miles grows to be eight years old (now played by Jackson Robert Scott). John and Sarah go out on a date and leave him with a babysitter named Zoe (Elisa Moolecherry). After watching TV  Zoe offers to play Hide and Seek with Miles before putting him to bed. As he goes to hide  he loosens a light bulb to the basement. Zoe walks downstairs to find him while barefoot  ending with her stepping on a broken glass cup and getting a large shard stuck in there. When Sarah talks to Miles about it  he claims to not remember even playing the game  let alone how Zoe ended up at the bottom of the stairs with a bloody foot.As Miles sleeps later that night  Sarah goes into his room and hears him whisper  Go fuck yourself.  He starts to speak Hungarian again before waking up startled. Sarah suggests he had a bad dream  but he says he was having a good dream.Another incident occurs at school when Miles wants to work on a project with a girl  but she is already working with another boy. Miles goes to the janitor\'s closet and grabs a wrench before bringing it back to class to beat the boy. Miles is later taken to see a psychologist named Dr. Elaine Strasser (Paula Boudreau). She later meets with Sarah and a colleague named Arthur Jacobsen (Colm Feore). They reviewed a tape that Sarah recorded of Miles speaking Hungarian  and Arthur says that it\'s a rare dialect that only a small portion of people in Hungary speak. It translates to something threatening and insulting toward a woman. Arthur mentions a time he went to India and spoke to a six-year-old boy named Padman who claimed to have remembered a past life of his  including his siblings  his mother\'s favorite song  and the moment in which he died by drowning. He suggests that Miles has a separate personality in his head and that they need to get Miles to be his normal self before the dark personality becomes dominant. Sarah dismisses what the two say as ridiculous  but they give her a video to watch on a similar case.The family\'s dog Tallulah disappears. John takes Miles to go looking for her on the streets  and Miles starts making disturbing comments alluding to Tallulah being dead  as well as the abuse John suffered at the hands of his father.

After Miles later suggests that John had been abusing him  John angrily steps out of the house and stays elsewhere for a while.Sarah wakes up at night and finds Miles at the end of the hallway crying for her.

He orders Arthur to tell Sarah that the process didn\'t work. After they leave  Arthur notices that Miles managed to scratch Scarka\'s name into the couch. Arthur calls Sarah late at night to get her to look up Scarka\'s name on the computer where Miles can\'t see her. She learns that Scarka was a serial killer who murdered multiple women and always severed and kept one of their hands as a trophy.

Barely ten minutes into the bus ride  June becomes paranoid that her father will not be able to handle himself without her  so she uses Banky to create a distraction on the bus and get them to pull over. June uses the opportunity to run back home through the woods. She then finds a burnt piece of the Wonderland map flying toward it. June chases after it as it takes her deeper into the woods  and she finds herself in a completely different place. She steps inside a rocket ride and is transported into Wonderland before her very eyes...or at least  what used to be Wonderland.When June gets down to the park  she finds the animals all fleeing in terror from a dark storm cloud. Emerging from it are Chimpanzombies  formerly the park's Wonder Chimps now becoming terrible troublemakers. The animals run and evade the Chimpanzombies. June introduces herself and tells the animals that she and her mom are responsible for creating them. Greta seems to be suspicious of June being there  but she proves what she knows about them due to naming a very specific way that Steve drinks his tea. June asks them what happened to Peanut  and they tell her that he went off on his own to reactivate Clockwork Springs to bring the park back to life  but he was captured by the Chimpanzombies.June leads the animals to Clockwork Springs to help fix it  but she doesn't seem to know what she is supposed to do. The Chimpanzombies then attack once again in a giant robot that wreaks more havoc across the park. In the chaos  June gets separated from the animals and finds herself in Zero Gravity Land. There  she finds Peanut hiding in a room he created to escape the darkness. He feels lost without hearing the voice in his head and he chooses to stay alone so that he can't get hurt. This leads June to realize that the darkness was created by herself as a result of her cynicism from her mom's sickness. The Chimpanzombies then show up and attack once again and take Peanut as their prisoner  but June manages to escape with Peanut's marker.June runs back to the animals to tell them that she found Peanut and his marker  but also confesses that she is responsible for the darkness. The animals are all upset  but Greta is especially displeased. They abandon June and leave her alone and helpless. After taking a moment  June gathers the courage inside her to reactivate her imagination and get a robot up and running to join the animals to help them. As they come up with a plan to stop the Chimpanzombies  they put Boomer on top of a roller coaster. His car gets pushed over by a bird  leading him to roll down the roller coaster without safety. The other animals manage to get him to come to a stop.The gang finds the Chimpanzombies taking Peanut to get sucked up into the darkness. The animals fight back while June rushes to save Peanut. She jumps up into the void and reaches Peanut. She convinces him that she will provide the voice for his imagination and that he cannot let the darkness take him over. June gives Peanut an idea for making a slide to get them out of there. As they slide down  June then notices Clockwork Springs is her name written in cursive  just like on the piece of her map. With Peanut's help  they get Clockwork Springs back up and running  which gets rid of the darkness  brings Wonderland back to life  and makes the Chimpanzombies turn back into regular Wonder Chimps. Children then start coming back with their families and are in awe of the animals. The animals welcome Peanut back as their leader  but he says that Greta did a good job leading them. They look up to the sky and see the cloud is still there  which June interprets as meaning that while the darkness may never really go away  it is there to remind us to look on the bright side. June says farewell to her animal friends before returning to the real world.June runs out of the woods and goes back home to her father  now with more spirit and vigor than before. She and Banky then get together to create more things to make a real Wonderland. There is then another knock at the door  and Mr. Bailey tells June she should get the door. He opens it  and Mrs. Bailey comes inside  now feeling all better. June jumps into her mother's arms.The Baileys then unveil the real Wonderland in their backyard  which is big enough to have all the neighborhood kids show up. June starts to tell the kids a story about Wonderland  and she takes a doll of Peanut and whispers an idea into his ear. In Wonderland  Peanut hears the idea  and he takes his magic marker to make the idea come to life.  , 'Go on the ride.'  'Dream bigger.'  'Take a ride on the wild side.'

She informs Haley about the impending category 5 Hurricane Wendy that is about to strike Florida. Beth expresses concern since she hasn't heard from their father  and she thinks he is still around the area. They have a slight argument since it appears that Haley took Dave's side in her parents' divorce  while Beth took their mother's side. Beth just asks that Haley get in touch with Dave.Haley starts to drive out of town as per evacuation notices  trying and failing to get in touch with Dave. She runs into an old friend/ex-boyfriend of Beth's named Wayne (Ross Anderson)  who is attempting to direct traffic as the storm starts to hit. He shows her where to go  but  out of concern for her father  Haley turns around and drives down a path to get back to find Dave.Haley goes to Dave's condo to only find his dog Sugar there. The rest of the place is empty. Haley calls Beth to inform her  and Haley suggests that Dave is at their old family home. Haley heads there with Sugar against Beth's wishes  especially as the streets have started to fill up with water. When they get to the house  Haley doesn't find anyone upstairs. She calls his phone and finds it in the kitchen. His car is still in the garage. Alerted by Sugar's barking  Haley goes into the basement where she finds Dave unconscious and with a badly broken leg. She tries to carry him upstairs  but they are attacked by an alligator that has made its way down there. Haley pulls herself and Dave to safety before barricading themselves behind pipes.Haley tries to help tend to Dave's wounds  but he tells her she should get out of there on her own. She refuses to leave without him. Dave explains that his leg got broken after escaping the gator. Haley wants to retrieve her phone that she dropped in the struggle  so she attempts to get through by staying hidden. She reaches it  but a second gator appears behind her. While trying to escape both gators  one of them crushes the phone. Haley's leg gets bitten  but she manages to blind one of the gators in one eye  while Dave beats the other gator's head in.

Dave also painfully manages to fix his leg.With the water levels in the basement quickly rising  Haley tries to find a way to get help. She flashes a light to two people  Stan (Ansom Boom) and Lee (Ami Metcalf)  who are across the street at the gas station trying to loot it with their friend Marv (George Somner). Stan starts walking over  but the gators get Lee in the boat before getting to Stan. He tries to yell out to Marv to warn him  but Marv watches as Stan is messily torn up outside the store. Marv sees too late in the mirror that a gator has come for him  and it immediately makes a meal out of him.Dave suggests that the only other way out is through a passage leading up back to the living room  as taking the stairs will lead to the gators. Haley tries to push the hatch open  but it is blocked by a drawer weighing it down. Outside  Haley and Dave notice Wayne and his police partner Pete (Jose Palma) coming by to check for people who may have been left behind. Pete stays on the boat while Wayne goes inside. Pete notices that the boat's turbine is caught in seaweed. Wayne enters the house to try and find Haley  but he is grabbed by a gator's jaws. Pete is caught outside by another gator as well  and he is brutally torn to shreds by other gators joining in. Haley makes it to Dave's side and begins to cry  thinking they will die right there. She also has been blaming herself for her parents' divorce  thinking that she made Dave turn his priorities toward her and swimming. He assures her that none of it is her fault and that she and Beth kept them together until they both moved out. Dave encourages Haley to keep pushing forward.Haley goes for Wayne's gun  but a gator bites into her arm. She shoots repeatedly until it is finally dead  and the bullets have run out. Haley then figures the only other way out is through the storm drain  which is where the gators came in from. She swims through it and avoids being spotted by the gators  but she does see that they have already laid eggs  and some of them are hatching. She gets out safely and runs into the house to pry the hatch door open with a crowbar  just as the basement has completely filled with water. Haley pulls Dave out  but he is unconscious. She manages to revive him  and they make their way outside.Haley and Dave grab Sugar and attempt to make their way to the looters' boat across the street  but they want to do so without making splashes so that the gators won't hear them. They are successful in getting the boat  but the flood waters become too much  and it pushes the boat back into the house. Haley finds a radio and tries to call for help. Dave tries to protect Sugar from a gator  and he gets his arm bitten off. Haley is trapped in the upstairs bathroom with a gator as the water level rises in there  but she manages to trap it in the shower before getting back to Dave.The two take Sugar outside as they head to higher ground. Another gator attempts to attack Haley  but it gets swept away by the current. She and Dave lay on the roof as a helicopter comes near.

Those feelings changed when on a beach in Guatemala in 1998  she watched in horror as her son John (Jude Collie) was murdered by a T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  shattering her world once again.22 years later in Mexico  a couple watches as a glowing ball of light drops a naked woman not far from them. The young woman (named Grace (Mackenzie Davis))  seems to be unconscious  but before they can try and get her medical attention  local authorities arrive  making assumptions on the situation. As they try to apprehend Grace  she wakes up and in a surprising display of speed and skill  disables the officers! She then steals the clothes from the boyfriend  and his car before heading into the city.The next day  Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) wakes up her brother Diego (Diego Boneta)  and greets her father Vicente (Enrique Arce)  before she and Diego head off to work at a local automobile factory. Shortly after they leave  a glowing ball of light appears  and drops a new Terminator known as a REV-9 (Gabriel Luna) into the apartment complex where the Ramos family lives.When Dani and Diego arrive for work  they are surprised to see that a machine has taken over Diego\'s job. Dani goes to speak to the manager  showing her disgust that the factory is more concerned with automation than humanity. Dani tries to get the manager to consider keeping Diego instead of her  before returning to the factory floor. Heading towards Diego  she is surprised to see her father there  when suddenly  the sound of bullets are heard  and her father\'s body crumples to the floor as Grace attacks! Dani is shocked at the brutal attack on her father  before Grace grabs her  and Diego follows! As they run  the REV-9 morphs out of his Vicente disguise and gives chase. Grace attempts to fend off the attacks  but is helped when Diego drops a car engine on it!This buys the group some time to escape in a truck  but not before the REV-9 gives chase in a bigger truck  leading to a chase onto the nearby freeway. The chase leads to the truck the group is in to crash  with Diego being impaled by metal bars. Dani does not want to leave her brother  but is pulled away in time as the REV-9 crashes a vehicle into the truck  destroying it and Diego!The Terminator has now split into two formidable foes  one a metal endo-skeleton  and the other made of liquid metal. As Grace prepares for a last stand  an SUV skids to a stop  and out comes Sarah  wielding weaponry that incapacitates both of the REV-9\'s forms. As Sarah examines her handiwork  Grace and Dani jump into Sarah\'s SUV and drive off.Some distance away  Grace\'s body begins to shut down due to the energy she expended in trying to fend off the REV-9. Dani claims they should go to the Police  but Grace claims that will only lead to the REV-9 finding them faster. Dani then takes Grace to a pharmacy  where Grace grabs a number of medicines  before collapsing on the way out. However  Dani is surprised to find Sarah outside  having tracked them down! She explains that both Diego and Vicente are dead  before tossing Dani\'s phone out the window  claiming that it can aid the new Terminator in tracking them down.Taking them to a motel  Sarah gives the unconscious Grace the medicines she needs. When Grace awakes  she and Sarah come to blows  before explaining their stories. Sarah tells how she claimed to have stopped Skynet from creating Judgment Day but lost her son John  leading to her hunting down Terminators.Grace explains that she came from the year 2042  but instead of Skynet  the threat against humanity came from something called Legion. When Sarah claims she seems  almost human   Grace explains that she is human  but has just been enhanced to fight the machines.Leaving the motel  the group are unsure where to go. When Grace inquires how Sarah knew where to find them  she tells that it is from an unknown source. This source sends Sarah coordinates that show where a Terminator will show up  and each text includes the words   For John.  Grace manages to use her enhanced cybernetics to hack into the phone  and finds that the texts originate from Laredo  Texas. Dani directs them to head to her Uncle  who can get them across the border  feeling that whomever is sending the messages may be able to help them.Meanwhile  the REV-9 has infiltrated a surveillance system  and begins trying to track them down.The three women manage to hop aboard a train  to get to Dani\'s Uncle. On the trip  Dani asks Grace more about the future. Grace explains it took only three days to bring the world to it\'s knees. She lost her parents  but was saved by those fighting back against the machines  before volunteering to come back in time to protect Dani. Sarah then claims she knows why: with John now out of the picture  Dani is the  new Sarah   and will surely give birth to the savior of the future.The three soon meet Dani\'s uncle Felipe (Tristan Ulloa). As he and his associates help to get them across the border  the REV-9 is tracking their progress  and sends a false statement to US Border Patrol  claiming the group are hostiles. When they emerge from under a hole in the border wall  government agents are waiting for them. As they are taken away  the REV-9 attempts to down a drone and kill Dani  but not before Grace manages to save her  but ends up badly injured.After they are taken to a facility  the three women are split up. Dani is put in a cage with other detainees  while Sarah is detained elsewhere because of her criminal record. Medical staff are surprised at what they find when examining Grace  before she awakens and takes the group out. As Grace makes her way to rescue Dani she finds the REV-9 has infiltrated the facility!Grace manages to get Dani to a Helicopter  but Dani doesn\'t want to leave Sarah behind. Sarah manages to find the two and escape  but not before the REV-9 almost gets her! Grace chastises Dani for putting herself at risk  claiming she\'s  too important  to be doing that.The three fly to Laredo  where they find the source of Sarah\'s secret text messages...which are being sent to her by the same T-800 who killed John! Sarah\'s first impulse is to kill the thing  but not before Grace and Dani stop her. The T-800 claims that after he killed John  he remained without a purpose until he adapted to life as a human. Adopting the name of Carl  he formed a relationship with a woman and her son. This soon caused him to think of Sarah  and given he could sense when the time-flow was disrupted by Terminators being sent back in time  sent her the text messages to give her life purpose.Knowing the REV-9 is still after Dani  the group are unsure what to do to protect her. Dani however  claims she does not want to just be protected  and wants to fight. The group then go about trying to get her acclimated to using weapons. They also feel that the blast from an EMP could disable the REV-9  and Sarah reaches out to a Military contact.The group heads off to meet Sarah\'s contact  but the REV-9 is not far behind. Chasing them onto a military base  Sarah\'s contact manages to get them the EMP  and secures them transport on a heavy aircraft. It is here that Grace reveals the rest of her story  and why Dani is so important. It turns out that when Grace was a child  it was Dani who saved her  and united a number of humans in the resistance that fought back against the machines.The REV-9 manages to catch up with the group  and a fight ensues  wherein the plane is severely damaged  and the group plummets down near the raging waters of a hydro-electric plant.With their weaponry largely gone and the EMP having been damaged  the group attempt to fight against the REV-9 with all they have left. Carl and Grace manage to shove the REV-9 into the spinning blades of a nearby turbine  the friction causing it to explode in a massive fireball  severely damaging the facility  as well as Grace  Carl  and the REV-9.In the aftermath  the REV-9\'s liquid metal shell is deactivated  but it\'s endo-skeleton is still functional. Grace is also dying from her wounds  and begs Dani to use her internal power source  which should be enough to fry the REV-9. Though it pains Dani to do so  she retrieves the power source as Grace expires  before trying to take on the REV-9 herself. The battle appears to be lost  until Sarah yells for Carl to do something. He manages to take the power source  and pulls the REV-9 and himself down into the destroyed turbine core. At the bottom of the core  Grace\'s power source fries the REV9\'s circuits  and disintegrates the clothing and flesh on Carl. As he lays eyes one final time on Sarah and Dani watching him  he utters two words:  for John.

She is following the MGM studio manager  Louis B Mayer around. Louis tells Judy that there are plenty of girls out there that are prettier than her  but that she has something that they do not have...the ability that her voice has to reach someone\'s heart. However  if she wants to live a life like all the other girls do and work in a restaurant or be a stay at home mom  then she could walk right out the door with no strings attached.Judy apologizes profusely for her desire to be  normal  and that perhaps a chance to go out to the theater once in a while to see a movie with others would help. Louis scoffs and notes that if that is the case  then they could just bring in Shirley Temple for the film  instead. They reach the musical director  and they start the opening chords to  Somewhere Over the Rainbow. The scene dissolves to 1968  where we see Judy Garland (Ren??e Zellweger) much older and with her two youngest children  Lorna Luff and Joey Luff. She is dressing Joey and commenting that he needs to stop growing because it costs her a new set of pants every time. They are wrapping up a series of concerts at New York\'s Palace Theater where she is given an envelope of $150. A sum recognized as not what she was hoping for  but it is better than nothing.After the concert  Judy and her children head back to the hotel to sleep only to find that their room was released due to non-payments. Realizing that her children were tired and hungry  she resigns to take them to their father\'s home  her third ex-husband  Sidney Luft (Rufus Sewell).At Luft\'s home  Sid and Judy argue about what is best for the children. Judy  as their mother  expects them to be with her. Sid explains that what the children need is stability. And emphasizes that the children may stay with him  but that she is not welcome to stay the night. Judy leaves Sid\'s home and heads to her eldest daughter: Liza Minnelli (Gemma-Leah Devereux).It is at a party that Judy meets with her daughter  Liza  and finds out that Liza will be opening a show in a couple of days. After Liza confirming that she is excited and not nervous  a friend of Liza\'s pull her away to the dance floor  and Judy meets Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock).Mickey Deans enchants Judy enough that she turns down an invitation from her daughter to go to another party  and instead sticks around and stays up till morning with Mickey joking and chatting.There is a flashback to the teenage Judy and she is having lunch with Mickey Rooney in Hollywood. Mickey convinces her to eat a fry  and with much hesitation  she does. She jokes that they have to tie her hands to the chair to prevent her from eating more  and she would have to eat the fries with just her mouth. She then asks Mickey  are we on a date?  to which he replies that they have to ask permission from the studio head  he just thinks of Judy as a really good friend. As Mickey starts to take a bite from his burger  Judy playfully steals it and almost takes a bite of it only to be stopped by a studio minder who reminds her of her diet. Judy complains of being hungry  wherein the studio minder gives her a couple of pills and tells her to  take those  they will stave off the hunger  to which Judy complies. The camera pans out  and you see the moment as if it was in a movie scene surrounded by camera  press  and those behind the camera.We switch back to the  present day   and Judy\'s manager explains that without money in the bank  she is unable to provide and support her children. He then suggests that if she went to London  she would be greeted with open arms. Judy argues that she has to stay in the states with her kids  but is confronted with the reality of her situation.Judy takes a taxi to Sidney Luft\'s home and has a talk with her children  explaining that she has to leave for London to make money so she can buy a home for the three of them to stay in forever. Joey is upset and goes into his room  with Judy and his sister Lorna following. Judy takes his stuffed toy and suggests that she stays there with them because she wants to stay there with them. Judy then goes into the clothing cabinet and closes the door  pretending it to be a roomy home that they could all stay in (but still visibly upset with the situation). Eventually  she invites her children in with her  and they all fit in the clothing cabinet. They have a group hug with her saying  confirming that  this is where I belong. Judy is in the backseat of a car heading to the hotel where she meets her minder  Rosalyn (Jesse Buckley)  that takes her to her room with her upcoming schedule for the upcoming week. Judy dismisses her and attempts to make the most of her situation. During the next days  Rosalyn picks her up  and they go to the rehearsal hall  even though it isn\'t where she would be singing  the minder admits that the acoustics are amazing. There Judy meets her bandleader  Burt  who profusely admits his admiration of her  and goes to start rehearsing  except Judy complains of the dampness of the area. She walks around the rehearsal space as they talk about the location of the band and the audience  and decides that she cannot rehearse that day and needs rest. Burt asks about the set-list  and she states that it hasn\'t changed from what she has done in the past and that it will be fine  despite opening night being the next day  and leaves. Judy spends the remainder of the day trying to reach her children  to no avail  and is unable to sleep. She walks just outside of her hotel at 3:00 am and is sent warm milk as a way to try to fall asleep.Opening Night....Rosalyn realizes that Judy is late to the performance and hunts her down in her hotel room and finds her sitting in the bathroom. The minder and makeup artist dress her up and rush her back to the concert hall and push Judy onstage  despite her complaints of not feeling well. Judy appears to  click  into stage form and has an excellent opening night performance. After the show  Rosalyn finds Judy exhausted and crying  and tries to help clean her up so that she might go home and rest. Judy thanks her and says that she will meet her outside. Starting her concert stay in London.During the above  there were two flashbacks scenes:The first is teenager Judy taking pills in an attempt to go to sleep as she is unable to sleep.In the second  we find her on a prop couch where the studio minder finds her  and Judy complains that she is unable to sleep anymore  why can\'t she sleep? The studio minder takes her to another set where MGM is celebrating a  Judy turns 16  party even though her birthday is not for another couple of months. It is a beach/summer-themed party with a tank set up as a pool. The studio minder instructs Judy to cut the cake  but to fake eating the cake as she is not allowed. Judy starts to argue back  saying that her contract guarantees her one hour a day for lunch and that she would like that one hour for lunch  to which the studio minder says   no one ever does that.  As the cameras prepare to roll  the studio minder reminds Judy not to get her hair wet  to which Judy walks to the edge of the pool  pulls off her dress and jumps in. The camera follows her underwater  and we see her with a smile on her face.After a slew of relatively successful shows to follow the successful Opening Night  we come to the holiday season. We see Judy in her dressing room  Rosalyn asks if she needs anything and Judy says that she\'ll be fine. Judy asks if there is anyone at the stage door? Rosalyn says that she doesn\'t know  and Judy wishes her goodbye.Judy heads to the stage door and meets two male fans who have loved her for years. They mention that they missed her show in 1964 and decided to see as many of Judy\'s shows as possible during her current stay in London. After a bit of small talk  Judy asks them if they would like to hang out with her for dinner. The fans  in shock and thrilled  take her around London only to find that everywhere they went was closed. So instead they invite her to their flat  and she accepts.At the fans\' flat  they started to make omelets  except one of the fans  added cream  to make it better   and you find Judy comfortable in their presence. Later in the evening  one fan falls asleep on the couch  while Judy and the other. Play a card game and continue to talk about how difficult it is to be themselves in the current world. After a bit  the fan goes to the piano and starts to play  Get Happy   to which Judy sings. Before the end of the song  the fan slowly starts to break down and stops altogether and cries. Judy goes to him and gives him a hug from behind and notices through photos that the two fans are a gay couple  and are also massive fans of Judy Garland.Scene changes to Judy walking alone down a street... then cuts to Judy sleeping for the first time in who knows when but is suddenly interrupted by incessant knocking. Judy opens the door and is about to chew the bellboy out for bringing her room service on a day that she didn\'t ask for any and that for once  she can sleep  who then whispers that  there is someone underneath the trolley.  Out from underneath is Mickey Deans  who has come to surprise Judy.It turns out Mickey Deans purchased a one-way ticket to London to visit Judy with no plans for anything else  as he came straight to the hotel from the plane  and Judy invites him to stay with her.Judy has an interview where the interviewer attempts to needle more into her private affairs and her life working and growing up with MGM  to which Judy is very defensive. Which triggers her anxiety and causes her to run late in starting her show later that evening. Rosalyn gets her on stage  where the audience begins to heckle and throw food at her. As Judy attempts to sing  you see that she is unwell  and eventually  she collapses on stage. The scene cuts to Judy on the floor of the bathroom  and Mickey Deans waxing poetic about the world treating people like them as objects  and no one knows them as they know them.We flashback to after Judy jumped into the pool. The studio minder directs the costume and makeup staff that she wants Judy ready and sober dry within five minutes only to be stopped by Louis B Mayer  who dismisses the women and instructs Judy to enter a prop shed. Louis closes the doors and reminds Judy that she is Frances Gum  her father is a faggot  and her mother only cares what he cares about Judy. If Judy wanted to swim in a pool  she is welcome to his pool anytime and reminds her that he created her  he can break her as well. Judy apologizes for her actions and attempts to make amends by stating how much she has been working  and she was looking for a small break. But Louis insinuates that if she feels that a break is needed  he could find anyone else to do what she does  and he chose her. Louis walks to Judy and places two fingers at her chest to emphasize his point. Judy understands the insinuation and apologizes again  to which Louis leaves  saying   don\'t ever hold up a movie of mine. Back in the present day  Judy is talking to the London concert manager  Bernard Delfont  apologizing for her previous behavior and asks for forgiveness  to which he says  already forgotten  and that  had I know you weren\'t well I wouldn\'t have asked you to do the show.  The Bernard then says that he wants her to visit the doctor who will inject her with medication to aid with her strength.Judy is at the doctor\'s office  whom the doctor is a fan. He finds out that Judy had a tracheotomy two years previous  which weakened her vocal cords. The doctor talks about how  in his youth  he adored Dorothy Gale  to which Judy notes that most boys were attracted to the pigtails. The doctor disagrees and notes that it was how Dorothy took care of Toto that endeared him to the character. Looking at Judy  the doctor says that she needs to take care of herself and leaves.Judy and Mickey are walking in London  much closer and comfortable with one another. Mickey explains that there is a deal that he is working on where someone he knows is planning to open a series of movie theaters calling them the  Judy Garland Theater  and that he going to push to try to have Judy 10% of the profits so that she could purchase the home she always wanted for herself and the children. This would also allow her to no longer have to tour to live. Thrilled  Judy admits that she feels comfortable around Mickey  and they have a connection. Mickey agrees  to which Judy proposes that they marry  much to Mickey\'s surprise and shock. Eventually  he agrees  and they are married soon after.There is a montage of shows where Judy is singing better than ever overlaid with scenes of:Judy and Mickey\'s marriage  Rosalyn and Burt surprising the newlyweds with a firework show in their honor.Mickey on the phone eyeing the younger dancers  whilst trying to convince his connection to hold on the deal until he makes it back to the states.Mickey talking to his connections about the deal he previously mentioned to Judy.Judy is resting in her hotel room  and knocking is heard. Assuming it was Mickey  she opens the door happily only to comes face to face with Sidney Luft  who asks her to go out for a couple of drinks. At a pub later  Sid attempts at small talk in regards to her time in London and the show  which leads to his belief that the kids need stability. However  Judy disagrees and explains that she is doing all she can so she could provide that stable life for her kids because she wants them to be as  far away from this phony business  as possible. Sid finally admits that it is the children that wanted to stay where they are  that they do love and miss their mother  but they also want stability. This revelation causes Judy to bite back at Sidney and leave the pub to the hotel room.Once Judy enters  she sees Mickey\'s briefcase and is instantly calmed that he has returned. However  Mickey doesn\'t return Judy\'s enthusiasm attempting to explain to her that people still consider her unreliable and difficult to work with and ergo because of that reputation he is unable to close the deal. This upsets Judy so much that she accuses Mickey to be no different than all the other men in her life that sit at the sidelines as she is singing in concerts and assume that is work. Mickey bites back  saying that if she stayed off the drugs and was more consistent in her work ethic  he would have been able to close the deal. This causes Judy to leave the hotel room in anger and heads to her show.At the concert  Judy\'s anger takes over and that in combination with the heckling from the audience is forced off the stage  to be replaced by the backup act: Lonnie Donegan. Judy wanders aimlessly through the streets of London and comes across a phone booth. She puts in a few coins and connects with her children. Judy talks to her daughter  Lorna  who admits that they miss her  but they do like being able to go to school  and not having to move all the time. Lorna then asks if her mom would be OK  and Judy thru her sadness  says that she\'ll be fine  and says that she loves them both  before hanging up.The next day  Judy has packed up all her belongings and is ready to leave. Her concert series  having abruptly ended Rosalyn explains they have one more surprise for her. In the restaurant at the hotel  they are joined by Burt  and a cake arrives for Judy. Rosalyn cuts the cake and gives Judy a slice. As the other two start to eat the cake  Judy stares at her piece. Eventually  she eats a piece of it and admits that it was good  and continues to eat another piece. After admitting that there isn\'t anything lined up for her yet  Judy asks Rosalyn if it would be possible to see the show of her backup act.Flashback and a younger Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland just got offstage in joy. Mickey suggests that they leave and enjoy the evening  but the continuous applause catches Judy\'s attention. After a little back and forth  Judy turns down Mickey\'s invitation and stays to listen to the applause.Back in the present day  Rosalyn and Judy are backstage  Rosalyn asks if Judy will be OK  and Judy admits that she\'ll be fine. Rosalyn leaves to sit in the house  and Judy sees Lonnie prepping to be onstage. In the meantime  the couple we met earlier is at the ticket booth demanding a refund on their tickets because they came to see Judy Garland only to find that she is no longer performing. Cutting back to the backstage  Lonnie and Judy greet  and Judy wishes Lonnie luck in his act  but after a moment  asks if she could have just one last song with the audience to make up for the disastrous night before. After a few moments  Lonnie agrees  and Judy goes onstage and tells Burt to pick a song. Judy sings  San Francisco   which catches the attention of the couple outside  forcing them to run to their seats  and ends in rousing applause.Judy starts to leave the stage only to find she loves it too much and admits she might have one more song left in her. She talks about the song and how people seem to equate it to being a destination  but she sees the song is being about the journey and the steps one takes during that journey. She sits at the end of the stage  closest to the audience and begins to sing  Over the Rainbow.  As she nears the end  she breaks down  unable to finish the song.The couple then stands and starts to sing the chorus of  Over the Rainbow   triggering the rest of the audience to do the same. Judy stands and smiles  relishing in the audience\'s love and asks into the microphone   You won\'t forget me  will you? Promise you won\'t. ' , 'Judy Garland: the legend behind the rainbow.'

Her professor challenges her to take a risk over the Thanksgiving break.Ben (Logan Miller)  seen earlier in the collapsing room  is a stock boy at a grocery store with a smoking habit frustrated at his boss\' refusal to promote him to a better role and higher salary.Jason (Jay Ellis) is a young stockbroker respected among his co-workers for his fast-paced and go-getter lifestyle.Zoey  Ben  and Jason are all gifted a puzzle box addressed from a trusted acquaintance: Zoey\'s professor  Ben\'s boss  and Jason\'s client. After solving the puzzle  a clue invites them to the Minos Escape Room for a chance at $10 000 should they successfully escape.War veteran Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll)  former miner Mike (Tyler Labine)  and escape-room enthusiast Danny (Nik Dodani) arrive and join Zoey  Ben  and Jason in what appears to be a waiting area. When Ben tries leaving the room to smoke  the door handle breaks off  locking the inside and revealing an oven temperature gauge.After Mike finds a copy of Fahrenheit 451  Zoey sets the temperature to 451??F. Embedded heat panels progressively turn on bringing the room to increasingly hot temperatures  causing panic among all except Danny who refuses to believe the heat is authentic. Zoey notices Amanda\'s uneasiness and tries to calm her with water from the water cooler. The group receive a phone-call advising them to follow posted rules.Zoey sees a sign asking for coasters to be used for drinks and the group notice an escape vent to the next room opens when they simultaneously push down on six coasters. Jason escapes first  followed by Mike and Amanda while Zoey realizes filling a glass with water will hold down a coaster long enough for her to escape the room. Ben and Danny rush to cover all coasters with glasses until not enough water remains since Amanda drank a glass earlier. Ben empties his flask into the final glass and the two escape just in time as the room engulfs in flames.In a mountain cabin  the group  barring Danny  grow concerned at how real the game is becoming. The cameras in each room do nothing when the group needs help. Jason seeks a seven-lettered name connected to  You\'ll Go Down in History  to unlock the cabin door. Ben has a flashback where he was driving with friends singing  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer  just before a head-on collision. Ben gives RUDOLPH as the code and the group exit and enter frigid temperatures on a frozen stream just as the cabin doors and windows lock shut. Searching their surroundings  Jason locates a door needing a key and the others find a compass  fishing rod  magnet  and ice fishing hole. Jason grows concerned when he recognizes a red parka the group find and take turns wearing to stay warm.The group fish out a key encased in a cube of ice. Danny attempts to retrieve Ben\'s lighter to melt the cube but falls into the ice with the lighter and drowns. The group are distraught at the loss of Danny and alarmed at how calculated his death was  noting he fell into the ice when he grabbed the lighter. Fearing hypothermia  Jason convinces the group to huddle and use their collective body heat to melt the ice. Once they retrieve the key Jason manages to turn the lock  but the door does not open. The group escape across the stream into a new door that opens just as all the remaining ice collapses beneath them.The third room is an inverted bar with pool tables. As the group enter  they feel the entire room elevate to a new altitude. They notice a door without a doorknob; Mike thinks the eight-ball missing from the pool table must be the doorknob hidden somewhere in the bar. A telephone cord drops from the ceiling and the call warns the group to watch their steps. Music begins to play followed by an ear-piercing dial-up sound. Each time the sequence is repeated  a portion of the floor falls away. Amanda climbs up the wall behind the bar and finds a safe with a four-digit code. The group find the numbers they need in a sliding tile puzzle solved by Zoey but cannot open the safe.Zoey briefly falls unconscious and has a flashback to a plane crash where she was the lone survivor left upside down while everyone was strapped to their seat. All pieces of the floor fall and Mike  Ben  Jason  and Zoey congregate near the exit. Zoey tells Amanda to enter the numbers inverted and in reverse to replicate the room conditions. Amanda successfully unlocks the eight-ball but cannot safely climb across to join the group. Sacrificing herself  Amanda manages to throw the eight-ball to Jason just as she plummets to her death.The group enter a hospital ward containing beds identical to ones each of the game\'s players were treated in after being declared as sole survivors: Zoey survived a plane crash  Mike was the only miner pulled alive after a cave-in  all of Ben\'s friends were killed after he drove drunk  and only Jason was found by the Coast Guard after he and his college roommate\'s boat overturned in frigid waters. The group learn Danny\'s entire family was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning and Amanda was the only soldier in her unit to survive an IED blast in Iraq. The remaining survivors realize deliberate planning led to them all arriving at the escape room-to see who would be the luckiest out of the lucky-and aspects of the game have been modeled on their lives.A TV broadcast states the group has five minutes to live unless they put their heart into it; when time is up  the room will be filled with poison gas. Jason  Ben  and Mike locate an EKG machine to find the optimal heart rate that will lead to the next room. Zoey  wanting to outsmart the game-makers  employs the thinking of the Quantum Zeno Effect and disables all the cameras in the room with the hope of finding a way out. Believing a high heart rate will save the group  Jason inadvertently kills Mike by blasting him several times with a defibrillator. Once poisonous gas begins to leak into the room  Jason hooks himself up to the EKG and lets the poison lower his rate to below 50 BPM. The pathway to the next room opens and Jason and Ben escape  but Zoey refuses to follow along  purportedly collapsing and dying after disabling the final camera.Jason and Ben enter the fifth room with walls and furniture decorated by optical illusions.

He even calls the city about the cats who live there  which delays the demolition. Vengeful  G??nter notifies animal control that Bella is a pitbull (despite not looking like one)  because in Denver  pitbulls are illegal  due to being a dangerous breed.

Lucas picks Bella up  pays a fine  and is allowed to take her home  but he is warned that if Bella is captured again  she will be euthanized. To avoid this  Lucas sends Bella to live with Olivia\'s aunt and uncle in Farmington  New Mexico  until he and his mother can find another home outside of Denver\'s urban limits.

Although she is caught upon entering the agency  Molly makes an impression on Agent O (Emma Thompson)  arguing that she has proven her skills in finding out about the organization\'s existence and has no life outside of her search for the agency. Convinced  she is awarded probationary agent status as  Agent M  and assigned to the London branch of the organization.Once in London  M meets High T (Liam Neeson)  the head of the London branch  and manages to arrange for herself to be assigned to assist Henry / Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) in his meeting with Vungus the Ugly (Kayvan Novak)  a member of an alien royal family who is a close friend of H. During their night out with Vungus  they are accosted by mysterious alien twins who can manifest as pure energy  who fatally injure Vungus. Vungus passes a strange crystal on to M before he dies  claiming that he cannot trust H with it as H has changed since they last met. Although Agent C (Rafe Spall) expresses disappointment for H\'s dealing with the situation  M points out that few people knew Vungus\' location when he was attacked  which leads to the conclusion that Vungus\' location was betrayed by one of the MiB agents present when High T assigned H to guard him. Nervous over the possibilities of a traitor in MiB itself  High T assigns C and M to conduct an investigation while H is demoted to desk duty  with the investigation suggesting that the twins had DNA traces of the Hive  a parasitic race who invade other planets by merging with the DNA of the conquered species. M learns that H and High T were responsible for fighting off a Hive invasion at the Eiffel Tower in 2016  using a wormhole included in the original migration to Earth  but since that time H has developed a God complex  demonstrating an uncaring attitude towards his duties and apparently only keeping his job due to High T covering for him due to the soft-spot they have for each other.H convinces M to join him in following up a lead in Marrakesh  where they recover  Pawny  (Kumail Nanjiani)  the last survivor of a small group of aliens who were attacked by the Twins. Pawny pledges new loyalty to M  but they are subsequently trapped by MiB agents coordinated by C  who has recovered video footage of Vungus passing the crystal on to M and believes that she is the traitor. With the aid of one of his alien contacts  H is able to acquire a rocket-powered bike and escape with M and Pawny  where they learn that the crystal Vungus gave M is actually a weapon powered by a compressed blue giant. As they repair the damaged bike  H\'s alien contact manages to steal the weapon and take it to Riza Stavros (Rebecca Ferguson)  an alien arms dealer and H\'s ex-girlfriend.Traveling to Riza\'s island fortress  the trio attempts to infiltrate the base and recover the weapon  but are caught by Riza and her bodyguard. However  the bodyguard turns out to be the alien that M rescued as a child and he returns the favor by allowing them to leave with the weapon while he keeps Riza contained. The three are cornered by the Twins once again  but the twins are killed by High T and a group of agents.Although the case appears to be concluded  H and M review the evidence and realize that the Twins\' phrases could suggest that they required the weapon to use against the Hive rather than to use it for the Hive  especially when the only evidence of Hive DNA was provided by High T. As Agent C concedes that the evidence favors the idea of High T\'s deception  he allows H and M to follow High T to the Eiffel Tower. As they travel to the wormhole  M\'s questioning of H\'s memory of his defeat of the Hive reveals that he was Neuralysed  which is confirmed when they confront High T. The Hive converted High T into one of them and Neuralysed H so that he could act as the \'hero\' and conceal their true activities. The High T/Hive  hybrid  is able to activate a wormhole that will draw the Hive to Earth  but H is able to draw out High T\'s true personality long enough for M to use the weapon to destroy High T and the Hive infestation trying to reach Earth through the wormhole.\nWith the truth of High T\'s conversion exposed  Agent O joins H and M in Paris  where she grants M full agent status and appoints H probationary head of MiB\'s London branch.' , 'The Universe is Expanding'   The world's not going to save itself

After the game  the coach John Harrison consoles his son Ethan who missed the final shot of the game and his team telling them that next year they are posed to take the state championship as all their best players will be returning while their opponents\' will have graduated.In the next scene  Coach Harrison and the other teachers at the school all learn through a television news broadcast that the manufacturing plant  the largest employer in their town of Franklin  is moving to another city. Another coach explains that his best players\' families all work at the plant  but he assures Coach Harrison that basketball should be okay as he will still have his best players returning.Cut to a scene of high school boys playing basketball in the park. A young high school girl  Hannah Scott  walks by and sees one of the boys\' expensive headphones lying on the bench by where they are playing. When the boy realizes they are gone and looks around  he sees Hannah. She runs through the woods with all the teenage boys chasing her. When they reach an apartment complex  they lose sight of her and assume she ran inside. Actually  she ducked behind some rocks and tried to hide her heavy breathing from the boys to keep from being discovered. We learn she has asthma when she pulls out her inhaler. After the boys give up the chase and leave  she continues on to her grandmother\'s house. There  her grandmother holds out an iPod and asks Hannah where it came from  insinuating she stole it and tells her to take it back saying she already bought her one. After her grandmother leaves for work  Hannah takes the stolen headphones and puts them in a box hidden in her room  presumably filled with more stolen objects  including another set of headphones.In her office  Principal Olivia Brooks (Priscilla Shirer) tells Coach Harrison that the school is losing several teachers and coaches  and she needs him to coach cross country as she doesn\'t want the school to lose another program. He protests as he doesn\'t like cross country or even think that it\'s a real sport  but he doesn\'t have much of a choice. When he goes to tryouts  however  only Hannah shows up to join. She has a form signed by her grandmother  indicating she was born on Valentine\'s Day  and she has asthma. When the coach protests to the principal  she tells him even one runner matters.At the first practice  Hannah runs a respectable  but not impressive time. Back at the Harrison home  he complains to his wife  Amy  another teacher at the school  and tries to recruit his basketball-playing son Ethan to run cross country as well. Ethan says he will only if his dad will run with him to train  so Harrison drops that idea. A phone call from their pastor reminds Amy she promised that Coach Harrison would help the pastor with hospital visitation that night.At the hospital  Coach Harrison accidentally enters the room of Thomas Hill (Cameron Arnett)  a blind man suffering from diabetes complications and a former cross country runner. Hill says he doesn\'t often have visitors and invites Harrison to come back.Things go downhill for Harrison. He continues to lose basketball players and realizes he won\'t have a team at all  that his son will have no opportunity to get a college scholarship  and that all the teachers are getting a 10% pay cut. His wife tries to encourage him with mixed results. After Hannah\'s unimpressive performance at their first meet  Harrison returns to visit Hill and ask for advice on how to coach her. Along with giving suggestions on cross country coaching  Hill challenges Harrison to consider what his true identity is. If he\'s not a coach or a teacher or a husband or a father  then who is he? He answers that he\'s a Christian  and Hill asks him if his faith is so important why didn\'t he list it earlier.Hill shares how he had to lose his own eyesight before he could clearly see what was important-how he hurt so many people and was selfish. Harrison learns that Hill had a girlfriend  got her pregnant  got her on meth  abandoned his baby girl after she died. The baby was born on Valentine\'s Day 15 year ago and now lives with relatives. Harrison puts the pieces together and realizes his daughter is Hannah.Conflicted about what to do  as Hannah\'s grandmother has told her both of her parents are dead  Harrison asks Principal Brooks about the situation. We learn Brooks was a friend of Hannah\'s mother and has been the one paying for Hannah\'s tuition. She says she can\'t counsel the coach to go around the grandmother  but she also is sure that if they don\'t  Hannah will never know her father. So Amy and John ask Hill first if he would like to see Hannah  and then they ask Hannah. In their first meeting at the hospital  Hannah can only stay a few moments before she has to leave from all the emotion stirred up. She later returns and asks him to tell her what happened. Hill tells the story and says he knows he doesn\'t deserve it but hopes she can someday forgive him. Hannah says   It\'s hard. Hannah and Principal Brooks talk about all Hannah\'s feelings about her father-about feeling unloved  a mistake  unwanted  abandoned. Principal Brooks tells Hannah that she has another father  a perfect Father who has always wanted her and loved her and cares for her. They pray together  and Hannah asks Jesus Christ to be part of her life. Principal Brooks challenges Hannah to read the first two chapters of the book of Ephesians in the Bible and to write down all the things it says about her.She writes down things like:  I am blessed. I am chosen. I am forgiven. I am redeemed. I am loved. Hannah dramatically declares all of these things in front of Coach Harrison  and the drama class at school then returns all the things she had been stealing. She goes to her father\'s hospital room and finds it empty. Grateful to find he was only moved to ICU after a possible heart attack  Hannah informs him she has two things to tell him. First  she has given her life to Christ and second  if Jesus can forgive her for all the things that she has done  then she can forgive him. Of course  he is thrilled.When Hannah returns home  she finds her grandmother has come home early from work and is livid when Hannah tells her she was visiting her father. She feels betrayed. She tells Hannah that she was trying to protect her by keeping her away from him. Her grandmother goes to the Harrisons\' home and threatens them and the school with legal action if they ever help her see him again. Then she goes to Hill\'s hospital room and tells him to let her go  that he only brings hurt to everyone.All of them pray. The Harrisons pray together for wisdom on what to do. Hill prays that God wouldn\'t leave him useless after just getting back his daughter. Hannah\'s grandmother prays that God would help her to forgive all of the hurt of losing her daughter  of working so hard all these years to take care of Hannah. She says only God can do it.At a meeting of the regional cross country coaches before the state championship  a vote is taken on whether or not to allow runners to use earbuds. At first  opposed  Harrison quickly changes his mind and lobbies the other coaches to vote in favor as well.At the state championship  Coach Harrison gives Hannah an earbud and a player telling him to push the play button when the race starts. She does  and she hears the voice of her father coaching her through every step of the race. He tells her how much he loves her  how proud he is of her  how they are going to do this together. He coaches her to find her pace  to dig into the hills  to pass girl after girl. With the encouragement and expert coaching of her father  Hannah runs her best race ever and literally falls over the finish line  having given her everything to overtake the former state champion in the last stretch. As paramedics bring oxygen for Hannah  everyone waits for the final results  which were too close to call without review. When they determine Hannah won by leaning forward an inch more; her classmates hoist her on their shoulders and everyone cheers. Hannah\'s grandmother stayed to watch her race even though it meant she was late for work. After her congratulations  Hannah tells her she wants to see her dad  and her grandmother nods and tells the Harrisons to bring her home after.At the hospital  Hannah puts the medal around her father\'s neck. He is thrilled that she medaled. Then Coach Harrison tells him it\'s not just any medal; she won the state championship. Hannah wraps her arms around him  puts her head on his chest  and says   I had a really good coach. Hill\'s casket at the cemetery is surrounded by Hannah  her grandmother  the Harrisons  Principal Brooks  and others. The pastor says Hill\'s story was one of redemption. Hannah tells Coach Harrison that she  had the best dad in the world for six weeks. The last scenes are six years later. We see Hannah sharing her story with others in a group  scenes of her running cross country in college  and her opening up a box tied with a ribbon (one of a whole set that Coach Harrison apparently has in a drawer that he mails on her birthday) and inserting a flash drive into her player and running through the city while listening to a recording made by her father for her saying   This is your 21st birthday  Hannah. This is the prayer I have prayed for you for this year... ' , 'From the creators of WAR ROOM'  'What Do You Allow To Define You?'

They move in to the abandoned White House. Columbus decides to propose to Wichita using the Hope Diamond  while Tallahassee rebuffs Little Rock\'s hopes of starting her own family. The next morning  Tallahassee finds a note from Wichita and Little Rock  who have left due to Little Rock feeling Tallahassee still treats her like a child and Wichita\'s fear she is too attached to Columbus.A month later  while exploring a mall  Columbus is startled by Madison  who has survived Zombieland alone since she was fourteen inside the freezer of a Pinkberry. Madison (Zoey Deutch) quickly annoys Tallahassee  but Columbus invites her back to the White House  where she has sex with him. Returning and discovering Columbus has slept with Madison  Wichita explains that Little Rock has left for Graceland with a pacifist musician Berkeley (Avan Jogia)  and informs the group of more agile and durable  super Zombies . Fearing for Little Rock\'s safety  the group heads toward Graceland in a rundown minivan without any weapons. Tallahasse is enraged that Little rock is dating musician.. Wichita tells Tallahasse that he is over-bearing and is probably pushing Little-Rock away.On the road  the group tries to commandeer a luxury RV since Columbus has a strict  no clown  policy that prevents them from getting in an ice-cream truck. As they enter the RV the alarm goes off  and zombies attack. Methodically fighting back as a team  they encounter one of the super-zombies that takes multiple gunshots to kill  leading Columbus to nickname it the  T-800  after the Terminator franchise. Madison shows signs of  Zombification  after she is bit in the attack  forcing Columbus to lead her into the forest to shoot her. The group finds  the Beast   Tallahassee\'s modified presidential limousine stolen by Little Rock  at an Elvis-themed motel run by Nevada (Rosario Dawson)  who reveals Little Rock took another vehicle toward Babylon  a hippie commune where no guns are allowed. Bonding over their love of Elvis  Nevada and Tallahassee spend the night together.The group awakens to find the Beast being crushed by a monster truck driven by Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch)  who strongly resemble Tallahassee and Columbus. Super zombies arrive  and Albuquerque explains they have turned back from their journey west due to hordes of super zombies moving east. Facing the super zombies alone  Albuquerque and Flagstaff are bitten  turn into zombies  and are both killed. Nevada talk about  Murrayed  which a term used for shooting somebody because you think they are a Zombie. Apparently that\'s how Bill Murray died.Heading out  the group finds Madison  alive and driving the clown themed ice-cream truck (her Zombification earlier was simply a nut allergy triggered by eating trail mix). Rejoining the group  she explains that her nut allergy caused symptoms similar to Zombification when Columbus spared her in the forest. The group arrives at Babylon  gives up their weapons  and find Little Rock. A satisfied Tallahassee departs (he is happy to see Little Rock safe and sound)  only to find a horde of super zombies attracted by the commune\'s fireworks and runs back to warn the group. Left without guns  Tallahassee devises a plan to kill the zombies with exploding bio-diesel and then have commune members armed with barricade shields corral the stragglers off of a skyscraper with Tallahassee himself as the bait.The zombie horde is more massive than expected  and the group is surrounded and almost overwhelmed. Luckily  Nevada arrives in Albuquerque\'s monster truck  rescuing the group  although the vehicle soon rolls over. Escaping upstairs  the survivors corral the zombies off the roof. Tallahassee uses a construction crane hook to dangle just out of reach  but the last two zombies seize his leg as they fall  and Little Rock shoots them with a pistol given to her earlier by Tallahassee  rescuing him. The two reconcile  and Wichita accepts Columbus\' proposal of marriage. Little Rock breaks up with Berkeley  who hooks up with Madison; they stay behind as the group  joined by Nevada  leave Babylon. Columbus remarks that they have finally found their home in each other.In a mid-credits scene  Bill Murray witnesses the start of the zombie outbreak ten years earlier while promoting a third Garfield film  before making his escape while killing multiple zombies. In a post-credits scene  Murray is shown earlier practicing coughing up a hairball as a joke in his interview.' ,nan

They harass her and think she is a suspect they have been looking for until they see she is also an officer. One of the cops apologizes  but Alicia (a black woman) is used to this type of treatment by racist white cops. She continues her run and stops to visit her mother\'s tomb.Alicia begins her day at work with her partner  Kevin Jennings (Reid Scott). They drive around Kingston  which was Alicia\'s old neighborhood before she left to join the army. They pull over into a convenience store that had been robbed the day before (the police just  didn\'t  get the call)  and Alicia talks to a young boy  Jamal. His mother  Missy (Nafessa Williams)  sends him away  as she used to be friends with Alicia but hasn\'t taken kindly to her having joined the police force. She is antagonized by a gang member until he sees Kevin and walks away. The officers then go into the shop  owned by Missy\'s brother Mouse (Tyrese Gibson)  who is also rather cold toward Alicia because of her new life. Regardless  he lets the officers take what they want for free.Alicia is assigned to ride with veteran officer Deacon Brown (James Moses Black). They ride to an altercation at a nightclub. As Alicia attempts to detain one subject  Brown catches another one attempting to murder Alicia. He grabs and pins him to the car before pulling his own gun on him. Alicia tries to diffuse the situation until Brown shows her the suspect\'s gun. After taking him into custody  Alicia and Brown sit for coffee  and he tells her that the people in that neighborhood won\'t have her back just because she\'s black  and view her as more of an enemy because she\'s a cop.The next day  Brown takes Alicia outside a warehouse but orders her to stay in the car. She gets out when she spots what appears to be a drug deal  but the buyer runs away. Alicia then hears a gunshot from inside the warehouse. She goes in to find Brown with narcotics detectives Terry Malone (Frank Grillo) and Smitty (Beau Knapp). They are interrogating a young man named Zero (John Charles II) and two other dealers. He pleads with Malone and says that they will silence any word of their corruption  but Malone executes all three men. Alicia witnesses the act  and it is caught on her body cam. The men spot her  and Brown tries to keep things together before Smitty shoots at Alicia and sends her crashing through the floor. Realizing her body cam will incriminate them  the men rush to find her  but Alicia has already run  injured from a gunshot. The men see that she dropped her gun and is running around unarmed. They proceed to chase her through the streets. When she attempts to contact dispatch  Malone tells the operator that Alicia is just a rookie who got spooked during a drug bust.Alicia comes across Officer Doyle (Nelson Bonilla)  who appears to try and help her  but she overhears on her radio from Doyle\'s partner that they are working with Malone. Alicia runs away again and goes around the neighborhood trying to get help  but true to Brown\'s words  not a single person dares to help her. Alicia continues to run until she makes it into Mouse\'s shop. He finds her and attempts to get her out by calling the cops. Alicia hides as Doyle and his partner get there. Doyle harasses Mouse and intimidates him with his gun. Doyle\'s partner runs his license and sees Mouse\'s priors  but he doesn\'t report it to Doyle and they let him go. Mouse is visibly shaken up from the encounter. He agrees to help Alicia.Alicia contacts Kevin to help get her out of there. He picks her up and drives away with her. After she explains her situation  Alicia suggests bringing Internal Affairs in on the case. Kevin lets it slip that he knew Malone was the culprit  which alerts Alicia to Kevin\'s complicity in the other officers\' crimes. She fights him and gets out  forcing her to keep running. Mouse takes her to his apartment to shelter her.It becomes known that Zero was the nephew of Kingston Crew\'s boss Darius Tyrell (Mike Colter). He talks to Malone  who is in league with him  and the dirty cop tells Darius that Alicia went crazy and shot Zero and his friends before running away. Darius spreads word that Alicia killed Zero  which even Jamal sees. He goes into Alicia\'s room with a gun  but she draws hers on him. Mouse comes in to stop Jamal and sees what Darius sent him. Meanwhile  Brown and Malone try to cover their tracks with Captain Hackett (Deneen Tyler)  insisting they go after Alicia. Malone goes with Smitty to the convenience store to find security footage of Mouse helping Alicia.Mouse tries to help Alicia get out  but they are found by Darius\'s goons. They kill two of them  but knowing that more are coming  Mouse gives Alicia a chance to get away while he gets captured by the thugs. Alicia records a testimony on her body cam and leaves it somewhere safe before entering the complex where Darius lives. She is greeted with jeering and bottles being thrown. After entering the building  she is attacked by Darius  but Alicia quickly tells him about the body cam. After they find it  Darius\'s other nephew uploads the footage to the computer  thereby giving everyone concrete proof that Malone killed Zero. Darius lets Alicia and Mouse go  as he is preparing to bring hell to Malone. Missy  who is Darius\'s girlfriend  has a brief talk with Alicia regarding Missy\'s resentment and how they are not that different just because of the paths they took.A team of officers is alerted to the Kingston area to recover Alicia  which also lets Malone  Brown  and Smitty know where to find her. Once they get there  Malone kills Brown while Smitty encounters Alicia and gets a bullet in his head. Darius finds Malone and confronts him for his treachery. The two fight  but Malone shoots Darius dead. Mouse manages to sneak past officers with a cop\'s jacket and makes his way to the station to upload the body cam footage to the police\'s network. He is found by Doyle and is held at gunpoint  but the footage uploads in time  and Mouse disarms Doyle and pistol-whips him. Meanwhile  Alicia catches Malone and tackles him off a balcony onto a car  but a whole SWAT team has their guns drawn on Alicia when she holds hers on Malone.

Malone then tries to kill Alicia  but he is shot by Kevin. Malone and Kevin are taken into custody and Alicia and Missy reconcile with a hug.Sometime later  Malone is charged with the murders.

Bethany is travelling the world performing community service  Martha has become a popular girl in college while Fridge has been working out extensively. To celebrate the holidays  they arrange a reunion at Nora\'s diner in Brantford  New Hampshire.Meanwhile  Spencer has encountered a rough patch in his life while attending college in New York. Unhappy with his lowly supermarket job  he has also put his long-distance relationship with Martha on hold. When he returns home  he finds his maternal grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) sharing his room while he recovers from hip surgery. That night  as Spencer and Eddie discuss their problems  Eddie tells his grandson that college is the best time of one\'s life and that things are destined to go downhill as one grows older.Despairing that his life is ever going to improve  Spencer decides to re-don the persona of Dr. Smolder Bravestone within the Jumanji video game. Retrieving the broken pieces of the game which he had secretly kept  he repairs it to a barely-working condition and reactivates it.The next morning  Spencer\'s three friends are baffled when he fails to show up for their scheduled reunion and visit his house looking for him. There  they meet Eddie and his estranged friend Milo Walker (Danny Glover)  learning that the two men were once joint owners of Nora\'s and had fallen out after Milo chose to retire. While searching for Spencer  the threesome hears the dreaded drum beats of Jumanji and discover the game running in his basement. Reluctantly  they all decide to re-enter the game in order to rescue him.Upon entering the game  things aren\'t exactly as they were the first time the teens played the game. Although Martha is once again playing as Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan)  Fridge is now playing as Bethany\'s former avatar  Professor Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). Further complicating matters  the damaged game has inadvertently sucked in Eddie and Milo too  with them respectively playing the two remaining avatars  Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) and Franklin  Mouse  Finbar (Kevin Hart) respectively  and Bethany has been left behind.After Fridge loses his first life thanks to being eaten by an anaconda  NPC guide Nigel Billingsley (Rhys Darby) arrives in a plane and gives the players their new mission: evil conqueror Jurgen the Brutal  (Rory McCann) the murderer of Bravestone\'s parents has stolen a gem known as the Falcon Jewel which guarantees good harvests. The four adventurers must reacquire the jewel and  show it to the sun   calling out Jumanji\'s name to win.After Nigel drops the players in a desert  they are attacked by a herd of ostriches  barely making an escape in an abandoned dune buggy. It quickly becomes apparent that Eddie\'s stubborn impulsiveness and Milo\'s penchant for making long-winded explanations is endangering the group  as proven when Milo takes too long to exposit about the ostriches\' biology  resulting in Eddie losing his first life when he confronts one of them.Upon arrival at a place called the Oasis  the team runs into Spencer  who is now a female cat burglar named Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina). Eddie inadvertently costs Spencer his first life by capturing him and giving him to Jurgen the Brutal  who executes Spencer by beheading him  though Spencer thankfully respawns nearby. Following the clues given to them  Fridge and Martha obtain a desert fruit called the Jumanji Berry while discovering a pool of green glowing water which allows them to exchange avatars.As Spencer and Milo search for camels for the group to ride  Eddie gets into a brawl with about 45 strangers. The battle draws the attention of Switchblade  a mercenary who is Bravestone\'s sole weakness. Using a rocket launcher  Switchblade kills all the players with a single shot  costing each one of them a life. Riding the camels to their next destination  the team is slowed down when Eddie and Milo argue about the latter\'s choice to retire from the restaurant business  a decision which angered the workaholic Eddie. The fight ends when Eddie crushes Milo beneath a rock  costing Milo his second life.Eventually  the group arrives at the next level: a series of moving rope bridges spanning a canyon. It is not long before they encounter a horde of angry mandrills  which hound the players and attempt to hurl them off the bridges. Although Fridge is able to guide the team across using his avatar\'s geometry skill  they are ultimately surrounded on the other side by the vicious primates  and Martha loses her second life when she\'s tossed into the canyon by the mandrills at one point. At the last moment  they are rescued by Alex Vreeke (Colin Hanks)  whom Bethany has recruited. He\'s playing once again as Jefferson  Seaplane  McDonough (Nick Jonas)  while Bethany is now playing as a black horse named Cyclone. The two of them have brought along winter gear for the others to wear.Eddie and Milo reconcile  with the latter explaining that he is terminally ill and wishes to make amends with Eddie before he dies. As the group prepares to confront Jurgen at his mountain fortress  Fridge tells everyone that the mismatched avatars have been a major liability up to this point. Spencer\'s neuroticism isn\'t really well suited to a thief like Ming  Milo\'s long-windedness means he takes too long to explaining the threats any wild animal can pose to them  and Eddie is too hotheaded and impulsive to be Bravestone. Shortly after this  Fridge accidentally stumbles upon a river flowing with the mysterious glowing water he and Martha saw at the Oasis. All of the characters take the plunge save for Martha and Alex  resulting in Spencer  Fridge and Bethany being returned to their original avatars  while Eddie is now playing Ming and Milo is now playing Cyclone.Unfortunately  the two old men are captured by Jurgen\'s men shortly afterwards  leaving the original team of five to rescue them. Infiltrating the mountain fortress  Alex loses two of his lives to the booby traps trying to rescue Milo  while Fridge and Bethany pose as a pair of famous brothers Jurgen is expecting. Meanwhile  Spencer and Martha rekindle their relationship while finding and freeing Eddie.Inside the fortress  Martha battles Jurgen\'s goons to music while Spencer pursues the fleeing Jurgen. Confronting the conqueror aboard his zeppelin  Spencer deduces that the Jumanji Berry is Jurgen\'s weakness  using it to subdue and defeat the villain. Below  Cyclone is revealed to be a flying horse  which leads to Milo carrying Eddie to meet Spencer in midair. Spencer tosses the Falcon Jewel to his grandfather  who points the gem at the sun as instructed by Nigel. Their mission accomplished  the whole team cries out  Jumanji   ending the game.Nigel arrives to send the players home  but Milo expresses his wish to stay in the game. Eddie bids him farewell  understanding his motivations and thanking him for their friendship. Spencer in turn thanks his friends for coming for him  whereupon Fridge tells him not to do it again.

They are followed by police after Dell starts to speed up. He bets Philip that he can lose the cops  and he does for a moment until they corner him in the streets. They force Dell out of the car until he tells them that he was rushing to the hospital because Philip is having a seizure. They see him foaming at the mouth and then escort the two to the hospital  but they are just faking it and laugh over the cops believing them.Six months earlier.Dell is recently released convict who is meeting with his parole officer to try and turn his life around. He must obtain a number of signatures and hand them in by the next day. He goes around to different workplaces with little to no interest in what they offer other than the signatures. Dell's last stop is Philip's home. As he is a quadriplegic  Philip interviews several candidates alongside his assistant Yvonne Pendleton (Nicole Kidman) for the position of Philip's caregiver. Dell waits for over an hour to be called in  and he barges in during an interview demanding to be met because he has to go meet his son. Philip decides to listen to Dell's story  and when he mentions doing time in prison  Philip asks what he was in for. Dell tries to change the subject by turning it around on him and says that he must be offered the job after being asked that question. Philip does so  but Dell declines  as he is not interested in being hired and only wants the signature.Dell goes to a school to pick up his son Anthony (Jahi Di'Allo Winston)  but he is told by someone that his mother picked him up. Dell visits Anthony and his ex-wife Latrice (Aja Naomi King). Neither of them has much interest in Dell trying to be there now  what with him being absent for most of Anthony's life. It doesn't help that he and Latrice live in a crummy apartment that is falling apart. Dell gives Anthony a storybook for his birthday  except it's a book he swiped from Philip before leaving.Dell is contacted by Yvonne to come back as Philip wants to hire Dell for the job  simply because he was the worst and least qualified candidate. She doesn't trust Dell due to his criminal history and is concerned for how Dell will handle Philip  but he assures her he can do a good job. Yvonne establishes a three strikes rule on Dell to make sure he doesn't screw up  and she lets him know that the job is a live-in position  and it pays very well since Philip is so wealthy.Dell starts off rocky as he isn't quick to respond to Philip's calls via opera music  or he just makes things like feeding Philip his breakfast a daunting task. Dell meets Philip's nurse Maggie (Golshifteh Farahani)  who shows Dell how to take care of Philip physically. This involves demonstrating the use of a catheter and how it is applied  to Dell's discomfort. Slowly  Dell starts to adjust to Philip's needs and acts better. However  Philip insists to Dell that he follow a strict DNR (do not resuscitate) rule if Philip stops breathing. This is put to the test one night as Philip appears to be suffocating  but Dell  insisting he needs the job  gives Philip oxygen and forces him to breathe.After getting his first paycheck  Dell goes to find Latrice and give the whole thing to her and Anthony. She is somewhat pleased until Dell asks her to get the book back from Anthony since it wasn't his to give. Latrice gets upset once again and tells Dell to do his own dirty work. He then goes to find Anthony but finds him talking to a suspicious older man. Dell misses Anthony before he enters his building and has to leave when he sees some kids messing around with Philip's car that Dell was allowed to drive. He is then contacted by Yvonne  and when he returns to Philip's home  Yvonne calls his absence his third strike and tries to fire him until Philip clarifies that he allowed Dell to take the car to see his son.Dell takes Philip around the city after smoking a joint to ease a pain that Philip feels in his legs. During their walk  Philip tells Dell how he became a quadriplegic. His late wife Jenny (Genevieve Angelson) was suffering from cancer at the time  and so Philip proposed that they go paragliding to take her mind off of things. It was this accident that rendered Philip immobile. He cries as he thinks about Jenny. Dell tries to cheer him up by taking him to get food. During their talk  Dell also discusses potential business ideas he would like to get into with Philip's help.Dell finds out that Philip is in an epistolary relationship with a woman named Lily Foley (Julianna Margulies). They maintain a correspondence without having seen pictures of each other or hearing each other's voices. Dell goes through Lily's letters and finds a phone number. Against Philip and Yvonne's words  Dell calls Lily  but they only get her voicemail. Dell encourages Philip to say something  and so he asks her to call him back whenever she can.Philip joins Dell as he takes Anthony out for the day. Everything goes well and they have fun until Dell asks Anthony for the book back  and Anthony realizes it belongs to Philip. He gives it back to Philip but walks away from Dell.Dell and Philip go home to find that Yvonne has organized a surprise party for Philip's birthday. He is displeased  as he doesn't want anything like that. He orders Yvonne to get rid of the guests while he and Dell have an argument  which leads to Dell smashing things for Philip's catharsis. They decide to let the party continue and mingle. Dell even gets Yvonne to dance. Meanwhile  a neighbor named Carter (Tate Donovan) that Philip can't stand approaches him about Dell's criminal record and to reconsider keeping Dell around for the sake of the other residents in the building  but Philip ignores Carter. Yvonne then goes to Philip to tell him that Lily has called back and would like to set up a dinner date.Dell sits with Philip in a restaurant a few days later as they wait for Lily to show up. Philip gives Dell a check for $50 000 for a silly painting Dell did  but Philip wants Dell to put it to good use and invest it in a potential business. Lily then arrives  and she insists that Dell doesn't need to be there to help Philip.

Years later  Davis becomes a successful law enforcer working for the NYPD. Struggling with the legacy of his father  Davis has earned a reputation for hunting down and killing  cop killers   although he claims they were all in self-defense and is uncomfortable with the label.One night  two small-time criminals and former war veterans Michael Trujillo (Stephan James) and Ray Jackson (Taylor Kitsch) take a job to ransack a winery and steal several kilograms of cocaine it was keeping. The heist goes wrong when they realize there is more cocaine than they were expecting  and police officers casually arrive at the location. They are forced into a shootout where Ray guns down the officers. Michael chastises Ray for putting them in jeopardy due to the officers\' deaths. They run a red light in their escape (which leads to a pic being taken).Davis is assigned to the case. Narcotics detective Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller) is assigned as Davis\' partner. Davis and Burns come into conflict with FBI agents Butchco (Obi Abili) and Dugan (Andy Truschinski)  who attempt to take over the case (arguing that the perpetrators have left New York by now). But Andre argues that the perpetrators were only 2 and were confronted with 300 Kgs of cocaine and they only stole 30 Kgs. They clearly were not expecting 300 Kgs  so either it was dumb luck  or it was a set-up. And given they were not expecting it  their handler is in NY and hence they haven\'t left state yet. With the reluctant approval of the deputy mayor  the FBI  and the officers\' precinct head  Captain McKenna (J. K. Simmons)  Davis asks for Manhattan to be locked down  although they are given until only 5:00 a.m. to catch the criminals.Now on the run  Ray and Michael coerce their liaison  Bush (Louis Cancelmi)  to persuade their handler to give them a bigger cut in exchange for their identities changed for their escape. They are given more money and their fixer  Adi (Alexander Siddig)  gives them new identities and tells them to depart for Miami the next morning. Davis and Burns manage to identify Ray  Michael  and Bush (when Andre tracks down the owner of the car through its pic  which was Bush\'s ex-girlfriend) in the resulting investigation. Bush is gunned down by Butchco and Dugan when they get there first. After catching Butchco planting his sidearm on Bush\'s body and briefly scuffling with him  Davis feels more suspicious when a police force led by Lieutenant Kelly (Darren Lipari) quickly manages to locate Adi\'s apartment. Adi is mortally wounded by the policemen but manages to give Michael two flash drives before Michael and Ray escape.Davis and Burns manage to catch up to Michael and Ray; after accidentally killing a civilian  Ray is mortally wounded by Davis. Michael then holds Burns at gunpoint and tells Davis about the drives and how suspicious everything is before escaping. Burns chastises Davis for letting Michael escape despite Davis\' supposed reputation for killing those who murder cops. Michael manages to hide in a hotel room  where he unlocks the contents of the drive and realizes that McKenna\'s precinct was involved in trafficking the drugs from the winery and earning profits for it. After another chase where Michael abandons his money  Davis manages to corner him in a subway train and convinces him to surrender  promising to keep him alive. Michael is suddenly shot by Burns  who had also boarded the train and claimed that she thought Michael was still holding Davis at gunpoint. Davis berates her for shooting Michael  who secretly hands over the drives alongside the password to them to Davis before dying. As the police congratulate the two for their efforts  Davis realizes that Burns had contacted Kelly before Adi\'s apartment was raided.The next morning  McKenna arrives at his home to find Davis holding him at gunpoint  having found out the contents in the drives. McKenna reasons that the officers were struggling to survive on a measly pay  which forced them to go into drug trafficking  but that fails to convince Davis to walk away. McKenna  a hiding Butchco  Dugan  and Kelly - who were all on McKenna\'s payroll - then open fire on Davis. Davis kills all of them  including McKenna  who refuses to surrender. Burns  whom Davis deduced was also allied with McKenna  appears from behind and holds Davis at gunpoint. Davis convinces her to give up after revealing that he had already leaked the information online  and that he doesn\'t want her daughter to live without her mother should she get a life sentence for killing him.\nIn the aftermath  Davis solemnly drives off on one of New York\'s bridges in the sunset  with the drives beside him snapped.' , 'The Only Way Out is Through Him'  'The Ultimate Heist.

They do  however  have a friend in their teacher  Ms. Fine (Jessica Williams)  who gives the girls her phone number if they ever need anything.During lunch  Amy observes a girl she has a crush on named Ryan (Victoria Ruesga). Molly encourages Amy to go talk to her  but when she does  she says something awkward and walks away bashfully.In the unisex bathroom  Molly overhears classmates Theo (Eduardo Franco)  Tanner (Nico Haraga)  and Triple A (Molly Gordon) talking trash about her. She steps out of the stall and asserts with confidence that she will have a bright future since she is going to Yale  while Amy is going to spend a summer abroad in Botswana to help the women of that region make tampons. It turns out Triple A also got into Yale  in spite of her promiscuous reputation. Tanner also got into a good school  and Theo  who was held back a few years  was recruited to work for Google. Molly starts to lose her mind  and she goes around asking the other party-happy kids what schools they got into  like Georgetown and Harvard. After school  Amy notices Molly is pissed  and she vents that she can\'t believe that their hard-partying peers got into the same good schools they did while they spent their time in high school only hitting the books. They know another student named Nick (Mason Gooding) is throwing a party that evening at his aunt\'s house before graduation the next day  and Molly wants to go so that they can say they had fun while they were in school. Although reluctant  Amy agrees to join her friend.The girls put on outfits and tell Amy\'s parents (Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte) that they are sleeping over at Amy\'s. After they leave the house  they call their wealthy classmate Jared (Skyler Gisondo) for a Lyft ride to the party. He instead takes them to a party on a yacht that he threw  which he claims to be better than Nick\'s party  but nobody is there except for the staff and their loony classmate Gigi (Billie Lourd). She gives the girls strawberries and invites them to party with her. While Molly tries to find a way to get to Nick\'s  Amy goes to the deck to talk to Gigi  who is smoking a joint. After being told by a staff member that she can\'t smoke  Gigi goes crazy and breaks a bottle before trying to jump off the ship with both girls  but only she ends up jumping in the water. Molly tells Jared that he shouldn\'t try to buy peoples\' affection  and they call for another ride after she gets the address for a party from another classmate named Alan (Austin Crute).Another Lyft shows up  and it\'s Principal Brown doing his second job. In the car  the girls discuss the potential of Amy hooking up with Ryan  but she wouldn\'t know what to do since she is inexperienced.

Amy gets more upset and starts to argue with Molly in front of everyone  calling her out for always forcing her to do what she wants to do  while Molly hits back that Amy is a coward. Amy then reveals that she isn\'t just spending the summer abroad in Botswana  but she is taking a gap year to stay there  which Molly is only just finding out about. This hurts her as it throws off their schedules of graduating together and progressing as friends  so they angrily leave each other.Amy retreats to the bathroom to cry  where she finds mean girl Hope (Diana Silvers). As Hope says rotten things to her  Amy stands up to her and says she is only going to peak in high school. She then kisses Hope  leading to the two of them making out. They are about to have sex on the floor  but Amy messes up and eventually vomits on Hope. Meanwhile  Molly sees Nick with Ryan  finally realizing why Amy wanted to leave. She ends up finding Jared  who admits that he likes Molly a lot for how smart she is and how she doesn\'t have to try and prove anything to anyone else  while also telling her that Gigi is sad deep down  which is why she acts the way she does. Molly later walks outside as the cops arrive  forcing everyone to run out. Molly leaves after she can\'t find Amy. She walks home but is picked up by Triple A. Molly reluctantly gets in the car with her. She tells Molly that she got her nickname since she was said to give  roadside assistance  (blowjobs) to a guy. She admits to it  but doesn\'t like the reputation she\'s been given  nor does she like her nickname. Molly comes to an understanding with her and apologizes for using the name. She asks that they use her real name when they both go to Yale next year  which is Annabelle (although she isn\'t particularly fond of that name either). Back at the house  Amy is trapped with other teens that couldn\'t leave the house in time as the cops are searching the house. Amy tells them she is going to create a diversion  and she runs out to get the cops\' attention.In the morning  Molly wakes up to see notifications on social media about Amy being a bad-ass. She sees a video of Amy getting arrested  so she heads to jail to bail Amy out before graduation.

She asks Bernadette for a photo  but she silently rejects her. Bernadette goes to look up the video  which is a document of her work as an architect.

After apprehending two male delinquents who have assaulted a man for views on the internet  Dunn returns to his business of  Dunn Home Security . It is revealed that he is hunting after Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde/The Beast after his exploits in Split (2016)  which in this film occurred three weeks ago. Upon returning home  David struggles with the fact that his wife left him  not able to cope with her husband\'s superhuman exploits and beliefs.Meanwhile  Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde has kidnapped a small group of cheerleaders and holds them hostage  preparing to feed them to the Beast in an abandoned factory. Dunn walks through the streets the next morning  brushing against people who pass him by in the crowds in order to see into their past and deduce who the Beast is. He brushes against the nine-year-old personality of Kevin and sees a flashback of him speaking to corpses of young women his ego the Beast had just killed. That night  while Kevin transforms into the Beast and presumably attacks a group of homeless people  Dunn dons the rain-slicker overcoat of the Overseer and arrives at the factory. After freeing the girls  he is attacked by the Beast who is quicker and more agile than him. But Overseer is stronger than the Beast  and when the Beast attempts to crush him  Overseer leaps out of a nearby window  causing them both to land in the streets below.The two rise up and charge each other once more but are stopped by a group of police led by a mysterious woman who encourages Dunn to give himself up to avoid hurting officers of the law. The Beast is reduced to a confused and scared Kevin by the flashing lights that the police have. The two are then arrested and brought to Raven Hill Memorial Institution. Joseph watches helplessly as his father and Kevin are placed in holding cells. Dunn is placed in a room with water sprinklers which will go off if he attempts to escape. Kevin is held in a room with hypnosis lights meant to flash should he ever show outright forms of violence. Also at Raven Hill is Elijah Price  still serving his time for bombing the Eastrail 177 in order to find David Dunn and discover his powers of physical invincibility. The mysterious woman from earlier reveals herself to be Dr. Ellie Staple  a psychiatrist.Ellie Staple tries to convince the men that they are normal people with compulsions of grandeur but consistently fails. She then tries to appeal to Price\'s mother  Joseph Dunn  and Casey Cooke  former victim and friend of Kevin  but fails again. Staple gives the men three days to be convinced that they are deluded figures and not superhumans  otherwise they will be brought to trial for their crimes. Staple then calls Dunn and Kevin into a room to test their psyches. However  a seemingly dormant and unresponsive Elijah Price (still wheelchair-bound from the broken spine he received from his fall down a flight of stairs in Unbreakable (2000)) is wheeled in and brought alongside the men  much to David Dunn\'s disgust in being associated with him. During the meeting  Staple recalls Kevin\'s past abuse from his mother which spurred the transformation of the Horde  as well as the time David was nearly drowned in a swimming pool which nearly killed him--the first time water was revealed to be his kryptonite. She then tests Price\'s psyche by recalling a time in which he broke his arm on a ride at a carnival  bringing to mind the extreme fragility of his bones.Later that night  Elijah Price breaks free from his cell and meets with Kevin who is in his  Patricia  personality. After an intelligent discussion  Elijah Price reveals that he has not been taking his sedative medication  instead hiding it inside his wheelchair  thus keeping his wits about him and remaining sharp as ever. He encourages Kevin/Patricia to meet with him the next night and show him the  Beast.  Before Price leaves  Kevin/Patricia asks what his name is. Price turns his head and replies   First name Mister...Last name...Glass. Upon returning to his room  Price is captured by Staple who performs a pre-frontal lobotomy on him knowing that his genius must be quelled before he can put any plan into motion. The seemingly brain-dead Price is brought back to his cell but suddenly comes alive and kills his caretaker by slashing his throat with a shard of broken glass. It is then revealed that Price had planned to be caught by Staple  and had sabotaged the machine earlier should the operation be conducted on him. Price then escapes to Kevin\'s cell and deactivates the  hypnotic lights.  He and Kevin make their way to a secret room where Kevin transforms into the Beast and looks over Price  discovering that he has been broken. The Beast immediately takes a liking to Price but not before Price explains his plan to have the Beast and the Overseer battle each other at the top of the just-erected highest skyscraper in the city of Philadelphia. It is there that the whole world will see and discover that superheroes do indeed exist. The Beast agrees and helps Price make his way through the facility.Price then communicates with David in his cell and explains that he had deactivated the water sprinklers. He encourages David to escape but David initially refuses. Price then explains that should David refuse to escape and fight the Beast  Price will blow up a chemical company  killing many people. Having no other choice  David reluctantly breaks down the door  dons his rain slicker  and runs out of the institution.Price and Beast begin by confronting an orderly who had maltreated Price years earlier. The Beast crushes the orderly and forces him to kneel before Price before beating him to death as Price watches  shaking his head at the man\'s stubbornness. The Beast then wheels Price through the halls  beating down every security force that tries to hinder them. The Beast captures two nurses and forces them into a van where he keeps them hostage. Two police officers show up but the Beast makes short work of them.Price\'s mother  Joseph  and Casey arrive in time to see the Beast notice the Overseer approaching. Price sits back in his wheelchair and watches in excitement as the Beast charges Overseer and the two engage in a fight. Staple also sees this and calls up security. Casey rushes out  hoping to calm Kevin down but he is too busy fighting Overseer. Price recognizes her as  the one the Beast let go  and smiles in fascination at her. Armed police arrive and separate Overseer from the Beast  but are quickly overpowered. Overseer manages to push the forces attacking him into an enclosed compartment before locking them in while the Beast manages to kill and eat some of his attackers. Overseer frees the nurses the Beast held hostage before being attacked by the Beast. Price had informed the Beast that the Overseer\'s weakness is water and directed him to a water tank the institution uses.Joseph intervenes and explains to Kevin that Kevin\'s father was on the Eastrail 177 as well which Price had destroyed  thus killing Kevin\'s father and creating the Beast. Upon hearing this  Price is overcome with delight and amazement upon realizing he created both a superhero and a supervillain  and declares himself a mastermind. The Beast thanks Price for creating him  but then explains that he must protect Kevin at all costs--right before breaking Price\'s collarbone. Overseer tries to distract Beast from Price  saying that his fight is with him  which Price finds amusing. The Beast then punches Price in the chest  breaking his ribs which in turn pierce his lungs and mortally wound him. Price exclaims with pain and falls out of his wheelchair  dying upon the ground.The Beast flings Overseer/David Dunn into the water tank and fights him in there  easily overpowering him. Dunn manages to break through the wall and the two splash out onto the institution\'s lawn. The water from the tank pours out as well and fills a nearby pothole. The Beast says to Dunn that they will finish their battle at the top of the skyscraper and begins running off in that direction. Staple convinces Casey to calm the Beast down to avoid any other violence and she agrees. Casey catches up to the Beast and appeals to him  causing him to calm down and revert to the innocent Kevin. Once his defenses are down  a sniper shoots Kevin in the stomach now that the bulletproof skin of the Beast is gone. Kevin bleeds out and begins dying.More police forces show up and Joseph asks them to help his father as he is very weak. One of the security forces grabs David and drags him over to the water-filled pothole  forcibly drowning his face in it. David is too weak to fight back and is easily overcome. Staple arrives and orders the guard to wait as she grabs David\'s hand. He then sees a flashback to her life in which she is a member of a secret society monitoring the actions and works of superhuman beings  quelling them should they draw too much attention. She tells David that if she convinced him he was human she would have let him live  but Price\'s and the Beast\'s machinations prevented that. She then leaves and David realizes his true insignificance as the guard repeatedly bashes David\'s face into the puddle  ruthlessly drowning him.Kevin dies in Casey\'s arms  finally finding the light and finding peace in the safety of his friend\'s arms. Elijah lays dying in the parking lot  a broken and pitiful mess. Staple arrives and tells him that she and members of her following have suppressed superhuman masterminds to retain a safe society preventing overarching divides of  gods  among men. After Staple leaves  Elijah Price\'s mother kneels over her dying son. Price explains painfully that he was not a mistake to which his mother smiles proudly at him saying   No. You were spectacular.  Price smiles wryly and dies peacefully.Believing her mission a success  Staple deletes the footage of all the security cameras which recorded the fight between Overseer and Beast. However  upon closer examination she realizes that Price had hacked the computers and livestreamed all the events to a private network. Thus  it was never Price\'s plan to escape the facility and force the Beast to battle Overseer at the top of the skyscraper  as such a plan would be too elaborate. His plan and everything he had worked for was now a complete success. Staple leaves the security room and screams in anger realizing her failure. Price\'s mother  Joseph  and Casey receive copies of the footage and upload it  revealing it all to the public in the Philadelphia skyscraper. The film ends with them sitting together as the videos of Overseer and the Beast and their fantastic feats are relayed and spread to everyone\'s feed and the daily news  revealing the world of superheroes to the public.The main title of  Glass  appears on the screen one last time and the end credits are laced with shards of glass through which scenes from the film as well as the previous films of Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016)  connecting the whole story together.' , 'You Cannot Contain What You Are.'

Hiccup (voice of Jay Baruchel) and Toothless infiltrate it to rescue captured dragons  with Hiccup wearing a suit of dragon scales to walk through fire. They are joined by Astrid (voice of America Ferrera)  Snotlout (voice of Jonah Hill)  Fishlegs (voice of Christopher Mintz-Plasse)  Ruffnut (voice of Kristen Wiig) and Tuffnut (voice of Justin Rupple)  all wearing scale suits and riding in on their dragons to fight the trappers. The heroes free the dragons and escape  unaware that they have left one behind.The Dragon Riders return to Berk  which is now wildly overpopulated with dragons that they have rescued over the last year  with one new dragon knocking over a whole row of dragon towers. Hiccup has been leading the villagers as chief  but he still doesn\'t feel that he is the chief his father was. Meanwhile  Valka (voice of Cate Blanchett) has been helping train other dragons. Gobber (voice of Craig Ferguson) suggests that Hiccup and Astrid should get married soon  but neither of them feel they are ready in their relationship to take that step.A notorious dragon slayer called Grimmel the Grisly (voice of F. Murray Abraham) arrives to meet with the warlords that have been capturing dragons. When they tell Grimmel about Hiccup and Toothless  he finds himself surprised  as he had believed to have slayed every last Night Fury. The warlords show Grimmel the dragon that was left behind  a white Night Fury ( Light Fury  as it will later be known). He decides to use her as bait to lure Toothless to him  and he doesn\'t worry about Hiccup since Grimmel sees him as just a boy in over his head.We see a flashback of a young Hiccup with Stoick (voice of Gerard Butler)  who tells his son about the legend of a hidden world of dragons. He had hoped to find it so that he can end the fighting between vikings and dragons.Toothless goes out alone at night and comes across the Light Fury. He becomes enamored by her and starts making an attempt to woo her. Hiccup and Astrid come across them  but they startle her and she fires a blast in their direction before she vanishes into thin air.Toothless falls in love with the Light Fury  which Hiccup can see. He takes Toothless and Tuffnut (who wants to give Hiccup relationship advice) back into the woods to look for her  but Hiccup manages to detect one of Grimmel\'s traps before it catches Toothless. He brings back a tranquilizer dart they found  which Eret (voice of Kit Harington) recognizes as Grimmel\'s work. He warns Hiccup that Grimmel most likely wanted them to find that trap as a means to lead him right back to them.That night  Hiccup finds Grimmel has snuck inside his house and seemingly tranquilized Toothless. He orders Hiccup to give Toothless up and expresses how he thinks humans and dragons shouldn\'t co-exist since he views humans as being superior. When he goes to Toothless  it turns out that he shot Fishlegs  and Hiccup\'s friends and family come out to ambush Grimmel. However  he summons his acid-spitting Deathgrippers to tear through Hiccup\'s home. He gathers the Berkians together and realizes that with Grimmel going after them  it is no longer safe to stay in that land. While some of the villagers argue against leaving their homes  Hiccup tells them that they are Berk no matter where they live. However  Grimmel was counting on them to abandon their homes all along  and he plans to keep tracking Toothless with reluctant help from the warlords. all while making more of the venom to tranquilize dragons.The Berkians travel with the dragons to another island to stay temporarily. The Light Fury appears to follow the group  but she vanishes after knocking Hiccup off of Toothless\'s back after mistaking him for an enemy. She reappears later that night  and Toothless goes after her. Hiccup wakes up and goes to try and help him out. Toothless does goofy dances to court the Light Fury  which does not impress her. He then manages to draw her face in the sand  which she seems to like. Unfortunately  she flies away again when she spots Hiccup  and Toothless is unable to fly after her because of his bad fin. Hiccup later decides to fix up the fin and paint it black so that Toothless can go and find the Light Fury.Valka heads back out on Cloudjumper to make sure the villagers weren\'t followed. They are spotted by the Deathgrippers  who try to attack and bring them down  but the two manage to escape and head back to warn Hiccup.Toothless flies until he finds the Light Fury. They take flight together as she demonstrates her ability to camouflage herself using her fire breath. With her help  Toothless is able to use his own power with lightning to achieve the same effect. They continue flying until the Light Fury brings Toothless to a waterfall.After learning Grimmel is hot on their trail  Hiccup leads the Dragon Riders to catch him  but he was expecting this  so they have fallen into his trap. He sends the Deathgrippers after them  but they manage to evade them and escape. They accidentally leave Ruffnut behind and don\'t realize it until they return to the island. Hiccup is then pressured into finding another solution to stopping Grimmel. He notices Toothless hasn\'t returned  and Astrid reminds him that he gave Toothless his freedom to be with the Light Fury.As Grimmel tries to make his next move  Ruffnut starts to annoy the hell out of him with her endless talking  so he frees her. Ruffnut inadvertently blabs about their new location  so he keeps a close eye on her to see where she\'s headed.Hiccup and Astrid ride Stormfly to find Toothless. They come across the waterfall and are flown down into the hidden dragon world  which is vast and beautiful. They see Hiccup acting as the alpha to all the dragons (you can even see Drago\'s Bewilderbeest among them)  with the Light Fury now officially being his mate. The other dragons spot Hiccup and Astrid and chase after them. Toothless and Stormfly grab them and flee. Hiccup starts to figure that the Berkians couldn\'t live with the dragons in their world and that maybe that\'s where the dragons ought to be.Ruffnut returns to the village  and Grimmel has followed her back. He and his men  plus the Deathgrippers  start to attack again  this time ending with Grimmel successfully capturing Toothless and the Light Fury. The other dragons are forced to follow Grimmel since he has their alpha  and he threatens to kill the Light Fury if Hiccup follows. Hiccup feels hopeless and sees himself as a failure as chief. Astrid encourages him as she always has  letting him know she was the first person to believe in him and will always be there to pick him up. Hiccup rounds up his friends with their dragon suits to fly after the ship.Grimmel brings his captured dragons to the warlords  but he tells them that he plans to kill Toothless for himself  denying them the chance to have him for themselves. The heroes then swoop in to free their dragons and take on Grimmel\'s army. They manage to steer the dragon trapper ships toward each other  causing the trappers to abandon ship as they all sink. Grimmel attempts to kill Hiccup  but he manages to free Toothless. Grimmel takes the Light Fury to the sky  leading Hiccup and Toothless to chase after them. The Deathgrippers fly in and surround Toothless  until he harnesses his lightning power and electrocutes them all before vanishing. He appears before Grimmel  and Hiccup jumps toward him. Grimmel tranquilizes Toothless  sending him falling to the ground. Hiccup tackles the villain and frees the Light Fury  order her to save Toothless as Hiccup and Grimmel fall. The Light Fury catches Toothless and lands with him on a cliff. Grimmel tears Hiccup\'s suit apart  but the Light Fury flies toward Hiccup. He loosens his prosthetic foot  sending Grimmel to his watery grave as the Light Fury catches Hiccup.The Berkians celebrate their victory until Hiccup realizes it is time to let Toothless go. He bids his best friend farewell  and the two embrace tearfully. The other Berkians must then say goodbye to their beloved dragons. They fly toward the hidden world  with Toothless sharing one last look with Hiccup.A while later  Hiccup and Astrid get married  making them chief and chieftess. We then cut to years later where Hiccup and Astrid now have a son and a daughter. They ride a boat toward the hidden world and come across Toothless and the Light Fury sitting together on a rock with three little dragons of their own. Toothless flies over to the boat and does not seem to immediately recognize Hiccup. He slowly moves his hand toward his snout as he did when they first met  and Toothless pounces on Hiccup for the first time in perhaps a decade. Astrid then brings the kids over so that Hiccup can introduce them to Toothless. They then take flight on Toothless  Stormfly  and the Light Fury together as a family. Hiccup says that although people now believe that the dragons are gone for good  the Berkians know the truth and will continue to protect their secret until the day dragons can come back out in peace.' , 'The Final Chapter'  'Fly on your own.

They are found by the super-enhanced Brixton Lore (Idris Elba). Because of his cybernetic augmentations  he is able to sense incoming attacks  which allows him to wipe the floor with all of the other agents. Hattie injects her right hand with the Snowflake and escapes from Brixton\'s sight. He grabs a radio and makes it seem as though Hattie is a traitor who took the virus for herself.Meanwhile  Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wake up in their own homes in Los Angeles and London. They go about their daily routines before later going to separate nightclubs to beat the crap out of dozens of goons before they each find one to interrogate. Both Hobbs and Shaw have heard about the super virus that has been going around  and they know it has been manufactured by a terrorist group called Eteon. Their respective goons fail to give them the info they want  so Hobbs tattoos  I Love Cops  on his forehead while Shaw leaves his guy dangling out a window.Hobbs has breakfast in a diner with his daughter Sam (Eliana Sua) when he is visited by an old friend/CIA agent Locke (Ryan Reynolds). He informs Hobbs about the Snowflake and just how serious of a threat it is. Although reluctant to help  Hobbs agrees to do so. At the same time  Shaw goes to visit his mother Magdalene  AKA  Queenie  (Helen Mirren)  in prison. She tells him about Hattie\'s predicament and that he should reach out to her  but he doesn\'t think Hattie wants to see him. After leaving the prison  Shaw is approached by Agent Loeb (Rob Delaney) to also go after the Snowflake. This leads Hobbs and Shaw to come face-to-face once again with Locke and Loeb asking them to work together. Their response?  No FUCKING way!  After exchanging insults  the two begrudgingly agree to work together. The other agents track Hattie down for the guys to go after her.While Shaw goes to Hattie\'s booby-trapped home  Hobbs manages to find her on the streets. She fights Hobbs to get away  while Shaw is fought by agents trying to track Hattie. He beats them all across the room  while Hobbs manages to gain the upper hand and bring Hattie in.Hattie is taken back to the CIA headquarters for questioning by Hobbs. Shaw shows up and informs Hobbs that she is his sister. She tells them that she is carrying the virus  just before Brixton shows up and attacks. Shaw recognizes him as an old colleague that he supposedly killed years earlier. Brixton attempts to take Hattie with him by going down the building with a harness  but Hobbs and Shaw pursue. Hobbs slides down the harness to get rid of Brixton\'s goons before giving Hattie a chance to get away. Hobbs fights Brixton  only to discover he is no match for the superhuman. Shaw drives by to pick up Hobbs and Hattie  and Brixton chases after them on a motorcycle  but the heroes lose him after he crashes through a bus. The three then see that Eteon has manipulated the media into declaring them all fugitives and traitors. Hattie goes off to try and find Professor Andreiko (Eddie Marsan)  the creator of the Snowflake and the one who can extract the virus from her. Hobbs shows that he was tracking Andreiko before the attack  and they manage to locate him at a newsstand.Brixton returns to Eteon\'s headquarters to get more juiced up. He speaks to Eteon\'s mysterious leader  who knows of both Hobbs and Shaw and wants Brixton to have them join Eteon.The trio talk to Andreiko  who says that he developed Snowflake for Eteon  but he left them after realizing their plan to use it on humanity and then force them to be fixed by Eteon. He tells them that the only way to get it out of Hattie is to kill her or extract it from her through a facility in the Ukraine. Shaw uses some of his own gear to help keep himself  Hattie  and Hobbs from being tracked or recognized. They head to Moscow using fake names  with Hobbs getting  Mike Oxmaul  and almost getting detained for it. While on the plane  Shaw tells Hobbs to back off of Hattie since he can tell that he is attracted to her. Hobbs taunts Shaw with the prospect of him hooking up with his sister  but their bickering wakes up the air marshal  Dinkley (Kevin Hart). He figures that the two are on a mission  and he bemoans his lack of action. Dinkley gives them his card for whenever they need something.In Moscow  the trio visit an old flame of Shaw\'s  Margarita  AKA Madame M (Eiza Gonzalez)  who is the leader of an all-female crew of criminals that rob peoples homes. She provides them with weapons and gear that they need to storm the Eteon facility. Margarita then takes them to the facility where she makes it look like she is giving Hattie up to Brixton  who is already there after interrogating Andreiko. Hobbs and Shaw sneak their way around the place after dropping in from a jet. They encounter armed goons and proceed to pummel all of them in separate halls. They then use the unconscious goons to get inside  where they are greeted by dozens of armed Eteon agents. Both of them are captured and strapped to electrical cables for interrogation. Brixton tries to get them to join Eteon  with each additional shock coming closer to killing them. Hattie sneaks up on Brixton and almost kills him  but the gun she\'s holding requires an identity reader. Hobbs and Shaw get free  fight off more goons  and destroy the facility after retrieving the extraction device. Unfortunately  Brixton snaps Andreiko\'s neck and gets away again  and the device gets wrecked. Hobbs then figures out somewhere to lay low.The three travel to Samoa  Hobbs\'s childhood home where his estranged family lives. He returns to his mother Sefina (Lori Pelenisa Tuisano) and brothers Jonah (Cliff Curtis)  Mateo (Roman Reigns)  Timo (Josh Mauga)  and Kal (John Tui)  plus his three cousins. Jonah is especially dismayed to see Hobbs after his long absence. However  Sefina knows how urgent it is that the brothers help Hobbs out. They go to arm themselves as they prepare for Brixton and Eteon\'s goons to arrive  but Sefina has gotten rid of all their weapons. The plan then becomes that the family will fight Eteon with their bare hands and wits. Jonah fixes the device to start getting it out of Hattie.Brixton and Eteon are tracked as they make their way to the island. The Hobbs men stand ready for battle. The Eteon goons try to shoot them  but Hattie has disabled their guns. Fists begin to fly  bodies are thrown  and bones are broken as the agents are demolished by the Samoans. Brixton grabs Hattie and starts to escape on a helicopter. Hobbs and Shaw ride together while Jonah and the others follow. They hook their vehicles together like a train as Hobbs throws a hook onto the helicopter to bring it down. The helicopter crashes down below. Hobbs and Shaw face off against Brixton while Hattie has all of the Snowflake removed from her  and she kills Brixton\'s goon. Realizing he is just going to intercept their every move  Hobbs and Shaw resolve to fight him by having one of them take a hit while the other delivers a hit. This proves effective  as it causes Brixton\'s programming to overload. After witnessing his defeat  the Eteon leader deprograms Brixton\'s enhancements  and he dies before falling over the edge of the cliff. The unseen Eteon leader then speaks to Hobbs and Shaw  implying that they will see the two of them again.Afterwards  Shaw and Hattie go visit their mother in prison and leave her a cake that may contain something that will allow her to escape. Meanwhile  Hobbs decides to bring Sam to meet his family  as he has decided to stick around this time.During the credits  Locke contacts Hobbs again as he is fighting with other Eteon agents over another  possibly even more deadly virus. Locke also managed to stab a guy with a brick. In another scene  Hobbs gets Shaw back for the Moscow fake name by having the police get him and address him as  Hugh Janus .

Her childhood friend Jin (voice of Tenzing Norgay Trainor) is more concerned with his social life  and Jin\'s cousin Peng (voice of Albert Tsai) doesn\'t have other friends to play with.

He calls the cops  which Zara and the mercs overhear on the scanner. Soon  the mercs fly toward the roof and spot Everest. Yi helps him get away  with Jin and Peng following. Yi and Everest make it to the top of another building with the mercs cornering them  but they are saved by the building\'s lights going off as they do every night. This gives Yi and Everest a chance to make it to the docks where Everest hops on a boat to go back home. Seeing how frightened he is  Yi hops on the boat to join him. Peng runs after them and is caught by Everest  while Jin reluctantly joins to protect Peng. He tells his mom he took Yi and Peng to Beijing for a college tour.Everest and the kids end up in a crate of sodas as the boat stops at an island. Their crate gets on a truck  but they all fall off of it after Peng and Everest get too hopped up on soda. This leads to them having to walk to the mountain to get Everest home. Jin complains because he is hungry  and Everest hums again to cause some blueberries to grow. However  they start to grow to humongous sizes before they start flying and hitting the kids as they try to run away. They end up resting for the night  with Yi noticing that Peng and Everest get along so well because Everest is basically a child who misses his family. Jin makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about Yi becoming distant from her mom and Nai Nai after her father passed  which upsets her.Burnish  Zara  the Captain  and the other mercs make it to the island  and they follow the trail of soda cans until they have a lead as to where they may find Everest.

They proceed to keep moving.Jin can\'t sleep and he begins to walk outside. He overhears Zara talking to the Captain. She drops her British accent and reveals that she never cared to bring Everest home safely  but rather to profit off of his existence  and she doesn\'t care if she has to hurt the children to get him back.

He ends up walking and going through treacherous terrain until he finally finds a vendor that gives him a boat in exchange for his phone.The other three board a train that takes them to the village.

He and Everest join Yi and Jin  but the Captain turns the van with him  Burnish  and Zara inside into a water vehicle. They chase after the heroes  so Everest removes the boat engine and hums to send the boat sailing further.

Even Burnish is amazed at this power.The gang crashes their boat on another island. Yi\'s violin is broken  and she runs into the forest. Jin follows her and asks if she is okay. She expresses her whole problem with her father\'s passing  and her distance from her mom and Nai Nai. Yi even admits that she hasn\'t cried over her dad\'s death yet. When they get back to Peng and Everest  they find that the two helped fix Yi\'s violin by using Everest\'s hair as strings  giving the violin magic powers. Yi then looks at the pictures she had saved in her case of all the places she wanted to visit with her father. It turns out all the places they have just been to in their adventure WERE all those places  but there is one place that she hasn\'t seen yet. The gang moves forward until they reach the Sichuan Buddha statue. Yi becomes emotional and starts to play  Fix You  (as her father did) on the violin. The magic from Everest\'s hairs causes the statue to become covered in flowers.As the heroes near the mountain  they are found by the mercenaries on a bridge. Everest runs to the top of the bridge and uses his magic to protect the kids. Burnish sees this and has a flashback to when he first saw yetis. He saw the mother yeti protecting her children  and he knew they were good creatures. He tells Zara that they have to bring Everest in safely. Instead  Zara tells the Captain to tranquilize Burnish. She then has the other mercs tranquilize Everest  causing him to fall to the bridge. Zara tries to use a cattle prod on him  but Yi attempts to fight her off.

This causes an avalanche that sends Zara and the Captain falling to their deaths. Everest is unharmed.

A lawyer   Queen  (Jodie Turner-Smith)  has dinner with her Tinder date   Slim  (Daniel Kaluuya) only because she didn\'t feel like being alone that night. Slim is laid back while Queen is more cynical. She tells him that her client was sentenced to death  which she doesn\'t consider fair. Slim asks her why she picked him as a date  and Queen says it\'s because she liked his picture  which she found  sad. Slim drives Queen home  trying to extend the evening. He swerves while driving  which attracts the attention of a racist policeman named Officer Reed (Sturgill Simpson). He pulls the two over and makes Slim step out of the car. Reed starts searching the car  which prompts Queen to ask why. Reed grows more and more agitated until Slim asks him to hurry up because it\'s cold. Reed draws his gun on Slim as he tries to arrest him. Queen gets out and tries to record the incident on her phone  and Reed shoots at her  grazing her leg. Slim tackles Reed and is almost beaten until Slim grabs the gun and shoots Reed dead. Both in a state of shock  Queen tells Slim they need to flee immediately.The two go on the run and ditch their phones. They stop to ditch their car and flag down a pickup truck. The driver  Edgar (Benito Martinez)  offers to help the two when Queen says they need to get gas. On the way  Slim notices Edgar is a sheriff. At the gas station  Edgar gets a notice on his radio about Reed\'s death and an identification on the suspects. He knows they are sitting in his car. As Queen and Slim realize this  they force him at gunpoint to go with them. They drive back to the car and lock Edgar in the trunk despite his insistence that he will help them. Queen doesn\'t trust him since he knows he will alert the other cops.Queen and Slim take Edgar\'s truck and stop to get food. They get a young boy to buy their food with money from Edgar\'s glove compartment. After they eat  the boy comes back with a video from Reed\'s dash-cam that has now gone viral  showing the two of them clearly in the act. Slim starts to drive away but accidentally hits the boy\'s father. He just hurt his knee so the two drive him and the boy to the hospital. The father praises Queen and Slim for what they have done  thinking of it as a revenge killing since Reed was reported to have shot and killed an unarmed black man years earlier. The father wishes them luck after they are dropped off.In the morning  the two stop to get gas for the truck. Slim enters with his gun to make the clerk pay for their gas. He agrees on the condition that Slim let him hold the gun. He makes Slim nervous when he points the gun at him but then returns it and pays for the gas.Queen contacts her estranged Uncle Earl (Bokeem Woodbine) for help. He is a pimp who lives with a few of his girls. Although reluctant  Queen gets Earl to help them since she claims he owes her.

She says she helped him avoid jail for killing someone: her mother. Moments later  the police show up at Earl\'s door asking questions. When the officer asks to search the place  Earl orders him to come back with a warrant. After the police leave  Earl tells the two that they need to leave now. They take some clothes from his house and burn the truck before taking one of his cars. Earl hugs Queen goodbye.Slim drives while Queen gets some sleep. They later stop when Slim asks Queen if she would have gone out with him again. She says no at first until she changes her mind and asks what the second date would have been.

Inside  the bartender gives them free drinks and tells Slim that they are safe there  letting him know that she recognizes him. Despite this  Queen and Slim dance through the night  reflecting on how they would like to be remembered when they are gone.As they continue their drive in the morning  the couple\'s car breaks down. They take it to a garage where they have to pay extra to get it back that same day. The mechanic doesn\'t support Reed\'s killing the way others in the area do since he thinks it gives cops more of an incentive to shoot black folks. The mechanic\'s son  Junior (Jahi Di\'Allo Winston)  is a fan of them and takes them on a walk around the area. Junior expresses his hatred for cops and claims he is okay with dying that day. In the mechanic\'s office  Slim takes the chance to call his father. They have one last conversation and tell each other they love one another. It\'s shown that there were detectives listening in on the call  and the lead detective arrests Slim\'s father for helping him. After getting their car back  Slim asks Junior to take a picture of him and Queen.Before making their way to their next destination  Queen decides to take a detour and stop at the cemetery to visit her mother\'s grave. He explains to Slim that she and her mother were close until Queen grew older. One day  she and Earl argued  and Earl pushed Queen\'s mother down the stairs and cracked her head. Since Queen had just passed the bar  she was eager to take on her first case  not realizing it would be Earl  but she let him go since she knew it was an accident.

Junior is later shot and killed as well.Queen and Slim go to the home of a friendly white couple called the Shepherds (Flea and Chloe Sevigny)  who help protect certain people. They shelter the couple and give them dinner. Queen says grace  despite earlier telling Slim she\'s an atheist  and expresses thanks for the time she has had with him  no matter how it ends. Things are ruined when another police SWAT team shows up outside  and the Shepherds have Queen and Slim hide in a crawlspace under the bed in their room. The two stay there until the morning when they think they are safe. They get out through the window  but Queen injures her shoulder on the way down. They go to take a spare car from the Shepherds\' garage  just as a black officer comes by to inspect the scene after he hears Queen\'s crying when Slim pops her shoulder back into place. The officer opens the garage door but lets Queen and Slim go  evading the police blockade on the street.The couple drive down an open street where they take turns sticking themselves out the window for fun. They reach a man who leads them to a friend with a plane that can get them away. He drives them to the tarmac  but as the two walk toward the plane  a whole squad of cops corner them. Queen and Slim have no choice but to turn around. Queen asks Slim if she can be his legacy  and he responds that she already is.

Slim holds her and carries her toward the cops  leading them to gun him down as well.News of the tragic end to the manhunt hits everywhere.

Jafar tries to hypnotize the sultan into thinking they are lying  but Aladdin destroys his staff  proving to the sultan of Jafar\'s treachery. He is taken to the dungeon  but escapes after his parrot sidekick  Iago brings him the keys.Meanwhile  the Sultan thanks Aladdin for revealing Jafar\'s treachery  and would be happy to have him marry his daughter. This makes Aladdin decide not to use his last wish to set Genie free as he promised  as he believes he cannot keep up being a prince without him. Genie is disappointed that Aladdin wants to continue living a lie and retreats to his lamp. Aladdin goes back to his old home in deep thought  and comes to see that Genie is right. He needs to tell Jasmine the truth. Just then  he realizes the lamp is gone and is now in Jafar\'s possession.Jafar wishes to become sultan  but when the guards refuse to obey him he uses his second wish to become a sorcerer.

Three men approach a tree where little mushroom fairies are hiding. The man grabs for them  and he manages to get a few. They are stopped and attacked by a creature with large horns. Two of the men are killed by this creature while one escapes with one of the little mushroom fairies. He returns it to the kingdom of Ulstead for an unknown purpose.The narrator states that it has been five years since Maleficent (Angelina Jolie) became guardian to Princess Aurora (Elle Fanning) after rescuing her from her father  King Stefan  but the story about Maleficent has been twisted to continue painting her as a villain. In the present day  Aurora is queen of the Moors  presiding over all magical creatures. The fairies Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton)  Thistlewit (Juno Temple)  and Flittle (Lesley Manville) come by to tell Aurora something  along with a little porcupine fairy called Pinto. She steals Aurora\'s crown and leads her to chase after her  only for Aurora to fall in the river. As she walks out  she is met by Prince Phillip (Harris Dickinson). Aurora realizes what is going on  and Phillip proposes to her. She accepts  to the delight of all the fairies. However  Diaval (Sam Riley) overhears this and flies over to tell Maleficent. Before he can finish his sentence  a very unhappy Maleficent swoops down to go find Aurora.In Ulstead  Phillip rides with General Percival (David Gyasi) back to the kingdom. Like most of the other people in Ulstead  Percival views Maleficent and the Moorfolk as murderous monsters. Phillip goes to his parents  King John (Robert Lindsay) and Queen Ingrith (Michelle Pfeiffer) to deliver the news that Aurora has accepted his proposal. They both congratulate him  and they plan on having both Aurora and Maleficent present for a dinner. We then see Ingrith travel to a lower level in the castle where she has several workers forging weapons. She meets a servant of hers  Lickspittle (Warwick Davis)  who is in the process of creating something dangerous by using a particular flower. It is also shown that Ingrith is using the cursed spindle as part of her plan.Maleficent flies down to meet with Aurora. She openly voices her approval over the engagement  but Aurora just wants Maleficent and Phillip\'s family to get along. Maleficent knows that she is not wanted in Ulstead  but for Aurora\'s sake  she promises to show up and behave. Diaval helps her practice being polite  while Aurora gives her a veil to cover her horns so as to make the people in the kingdom more comfortable.Maleficent travels with Aurora and Diaval into Ulstead to meet John and Ingrith. Things first seem wrong when Ingrith deliberately places iron silverware out  knowing full well how iron hurts fairies. Ingrith starts to pile on by bringing up Maleficent\'s curse and the disappearance of the men in the moors  suggesting she may have had something to do with it. The final straw comes when Ingrith says that Aurora will now have a real mother once she marries Phillip. Maleficent rages out and spreads her wings to intimidate everyone. When she demands to Aurora that they leave  John suddenly appears to fall ill before fainting. Ingrith makes everyone believe that Maleficent has cursed John  but she denies it to Aurora. When Aurora won\'t join her  Maleficent flies away. Ingrith has her henchwoman Gerda (Jenn Murray) fire iron at Maleficent  causing her to fall into the ocean. Moments later  a creature resembling her swoops down and rescues her.John is laid in his bedroom. Aurora and Phillip suggest that Ingrith use  true love\'s kiss  on him to wake him up. Since she obviously doesn\'t love him and is  in fact  the one who cursed him  it doesn\'t work. Gerda then reports to Ingrith about the other creature that grabbed Maleficent.Maleficent wakes up to find her wound tended to. She wanders and comes across a gathering of other Dark Fairies (or  Feys )  including Conall (Chiwetel Ejiofor)  the one who saved her. Co-leader Borra (Ed Skrein) views the humans as the enemy  blaming them for the disappearance of the fairies. They see Maleficent  and Borra goes over to mock her association with a human. This makes her mad enough to demonstrate her power against Borra  which he actually finds great as he thinks they can use her power against the humans. Conall then takes Maleficent across the land  which is a hidden society of other fairies that possess unique powers. Conall also shows Maleficent that she is descended from a fairy phoenix  but her ancestor used her power for dark purposes and was crystallized. He warns Maleficent about using that kind of power.Pinto sneaks into the castle and finds the mushroom fairy  but she gets captured by Lickspittle and placed along the other stolen fairies. Meanwhile  Aurora is staying in the castle  with Ingrith pretending to be loving toward her  but it becomes clear she is controlling  as she prefers Aurora wear her old wedding dress instead of the one that the three fairies made for her.Lickspittle is then shown to have completed Ingrith\'s weapon. He shows her how it works - the pieces of the flower are mixed with iron powder to turn it red and make it instantly lethal to fairies. Lickspittle grabs a poor dandelion fairy and causes it to burst into dust with the slightest touch of the powder. Ingrith gets ready to use it and has Gerda invite (or rather  demand) the Moorfolk to attend Aurora and Phillip\'s wedding.In the midst of a celebration  Maleficent senses something is not right. She flies to the Moors and finds that Ingrith\'s soldiers have taken the flowers. They have also ambushed her and fire iron bullets at her  but Conall dives in to save her  wounding himself. The other fairies fight off the soldiers and return to lay Conall to rest. Borra proclaims to the other fairies that Ingrith has initiated a war against them  and they will fight together as an army. Maleficent stays by Conall\'s side as he dies  in which he transfers his essence to her while he becomes part of the earth.The Moorfolk begin to arrive in the kingdom for the ceremony. Aurora then senses something from the spot on her finger where she had been pricked. She comes across Ingrith\'s secret lair and finds the spindle  which allows her to see that Ingrith stabbed John with a cursed end. She also discovers that Lickspittle is a pixie who was forced to work for Ingrith after she took his wings. Ingrith finds Aurora and has her guards imprison her.Ingrith has all the Moorfolk locked inside the chapel as Gerda begins to release the red powder inside  which kills some of the tree folk. Outside  Maleficent and Borra lead the other fairies to fight back  but they are hit with numerous powder bombs  instantly killing some of them and forcing them to fall back. Aurora tells Phillip what his mother has done  and when he learns the truth from Ingrith  who shows no remorse  Phillip defies her and jumps off the tower  escaping on a balloon. Borra swoops down and almost kills Percival when he attempts to strike another fairy  but Phillip intervenes. He tells Borra he doesn\'t want his mother\'s war  and he refuses to have fairy blood on his hands. Maleficent witnesses this and realizes Phillip can be trusted. She still goes after his mother and faces her on the tower. Meanwhile  after one more tree creature sacrifices himself to save the three fairies  Flittle flies into the organ to sacrifice herself  causing her essence to fill the organ with flowers that stop the powder from spreading. Knotgrass and Thistlewit then fly in Gerda\'s face  causing her to fall off the balcony to her death.Aurora runs up to stop Maleficent from killing Ingrith  saying she knows that she is not as evil as they say she is. Ingrith then fires an arrow at Aurora  but Maleficent takes the hit and disintegrates. As Aurora weeps  Ingrith tells her that she is the one who spread the stories about Maleficent being evil  as she wanted to take control of the Moors by wiping out the creatures there. Aurora\'s tears then cause Maleficent to regenerate into her powerful phoenix form. She causes the nearby tower to collapse  and Ingrith makes one last cowardly move by throwing Aurora off the tower. Maleficent goes to save her  and they tumble across the ground. As Ingrith tries to escape  she is found by Borra and the other fairies. Outside  Maleficent asks Phillip if he truly loves Aurora  and he says he truly does. Maleficent gives her blessing  and Lickspittle comes to give her the cursed knife that Ingrith used. Maleficent breaks the curse  causing the spindle to disappear and for John to wake up. Ingrith is then dropped out of the castle through vines before Maleficent turns her into a goat for her punishment. Phillip is happy to see his father again  and they both decide they\'ll wait to let Ingrith turn human again.Aurora and Phillip are officially married  with Maleficent walking her down the aisle  and the humans and fairies are integrated into both kingdoms. Knotgrass and Thistlewit argue over what color Aurora\'s dress should be until a nearby flower turns it blue  implying that Flittle might still be alive. Maleficent goes to rejoin the other fairies as she bids the new couple farewell  but cheekily promises to be back for their baby\'s christening.The film ends with Maleficent flying away across the sky with the fairies.' , 'Go beyond the fairy tale.'

In his youth  he joined his father  King Runeard (voice of Jeremy Sisto)  and other Arendellian soldiers to venture into the Enchanted Forest  where they came to know the four spirits of the forest - Earth  Fire  Water  and Air. Suddenly  the forest\'s inhabitants  the Northuldra  started attacking the Arendellians  and Agnarr lost his father before losing consciousness. He recalls being saved by a mysterious being. After he finishes his story  Iduna sings a lullaby to the girls ( All Is Found ).In the present day  Elsa (now voiced by Idina Menzel) hears a melodic voice calling out to her  but nobody else can hear the sound. Anna (now voiced by Kristen Bell) joins Olaf (voice of Josh Gad) outside as he contemplates the changes around him. Anna isn\'t bothered by changes because she has all the people she loves ( Some Things Never Change ). Meanwhile  Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) tells Sven that he is planning on proposing to Anna.Later that night  the gang plays charades together  but Elsa hears the voice calling out to her again. Distressed  she leaves the room. Kristoff tries to find a good time to propose to Anna  but she is more concerned with how Elsa is acting. After assuring her sister she is going to be fine  they go to bed.The voice continues to call Elsa through the night  leading her to leave her room and wonder what it is that is calling her  and how she wants to learn more about it ( Into The Unknown ). The magic around her shows her images of mysterious creatures. Suddenly  Arendelle begins to experience strange occurrences. A strong wind blows into the kingdom  the water from the fountains drain out  the fire from the lanterns go out  and the earth begins to tremble fiercely. Elsa helps lead the citizens to higher ground.The gang meets with Grand Pabbie (voice of Ciaran Hinds) and the other Trolls. He tells the sisters that the spirits of the Enchanted Forest are angered over a wrongdoing that must be corrected  or else Arendelle\'s future will be in jeopardy. Elsa decides she must set off on her own to fix it  but Anna refuses to let her go alone. Naturally  Kristoff  Sven  and Olaf join as well.Everyone travels far from Arendelle until they eventually reach the outside of the Enchanted Forest  which is surrounded by a gigantic mist. They are pulled inside and find themselves unable to get out. The group gets separated from each other  with Olaf wandering by himself and not understanding the weird things happening in the Forest ( When I Am Older ). A tornado created by the Air Spirit then pulls everyone away  but Elsa tries to stop it with her powers. In the midst of everything  she sees what look like images of memories shown through water. She freezes these images  with one that looks like a young Agnarr  and the Northuldra girl that saved him. The Air Spirit appears to have calmed down  gently blowing across the group  and Olaf even names it  Gale. The gang is then approached by a tribe of Northuldra led by Yelena (voice of Martha Plimpton)  as well as Arendellian soldiers led by Lt. Destin Mattias (voice of Sterling K. Brown)  whom Anna recognizes from a portrait in their castle. They become aware of Elsa\'s powers quickly  and Olaf even takes time to recap their last adventure together to everyone. Soon  they are attacked by the Fire Spirit  which starts to spread bright colored flames across everything. Elsa once again uses her ice magic to contain the flames. She then follows the Fire Spirit until it appears as nothing more than a little salamander named Bruni. When he sees that Elsa means him no harm  he settles his flames and warms up to her (no pun intended). They hear the mysterious calling once again. After Anna gets Elsa  they run back to the ice statues Elsa made and realize that the girl who saved Agnarr was Iduna  meaning their mother was Northuldra  and the spirits rewarded her deed by giving her a daughter with powers. This revelation allows the Arendellians and Northuldra to form a truce.Kristoff meets a Northuldra reindeer tamer named Ryder (voice of Jason Ritter)  and the two of them bond over the way they treat their reindeer (specifically the way they give their reindeer voices). He tells Kristoff that because of the mist  most of the people there have only lived in the Forest and have never seen the outside world. Elsa befriends Ryder\'s sister Honeymaren (voice of Rachel Matthews)  who shows Elsa that in addition to the four main spirits  there is a fifth spirit that acts as a bridge between the other spirits. After witnessing Earth Giants roaming across the land  Anna notices Kristoff is gone  not realizing he is with Ryder  who has tried to help Kristoff come up with an elaborate proposal. She takes off with Elsa and Olaf  which leads Kristoff to think she has gone away after learning this from Yelena. He expresses his sorrow but also how strong his love for Anna is ( Lost in the Woods ).Anna  Elsa  and Olaf continue their journey until they come across the ruins of Agnarr and Iduna\'s ship. Through the water memories  Elsa learns that they set off to find answers about Elsa\'s powers  even witnessing their final moments where they embraced as the waters consumed them. They search the ship until they find a map  revealing that their parents were headed for the fabled river of Ahtohallan. Elsa knows she has to go there alone  so she sends Anna and Olaf away on an ice boat that she makes. The two express their anger over Elsa ditching them  even if she did it for their own good.Elsa attempts to get to Ahtohallan across the water  but she keeps getting taken down by the Water Spirit  which appears as a Nokk. After taming the spirit  she rides it as she follows the voice  eager to find out where it\'s coming from ( Show Yourself ). Once she reaches Ahtohallan  she comes across her own memories and learns that the voice is that of Iduna calling out to her. When Elsa tries to find out what went wrong  she learns the truth: Runeard wanted to subjugate the Northuldra by creating a dam to limit their resources due to their reliance on magic  which Runeard hated. When the Northuldra leader tried to reason with him  Runeard murdered him while he was unarmed. Elsa gets too deep into Ahtohallan  which causes her to turn to solid ice  but not before she sends this information to Anna. Before she and Olaf set off to help  Olaf begins to disintegrate  realizing something is wrong with Elsa. Anna holds Olaf  and they reaffirm their love for each other before he is gone. Anna sits alone in despair until she picks herself up and vows to push forward ( The Next Right Thing ).Anna knows that the dam must be destroyed  even if it means sending a flood toward Arendelle. She goes to wake up the Earth Giants and gets them to follow her toward the dam. Mattias sees this and tries to stop Anna  but after she convinces him that Elsa learned the truth about the dam and why it must be destroyed  he relents and lures the Giants there. The Giants hurl boulders to the dam  which breaks it and sends the water flowing toward the kingdom.

General Leia Organa dispatches agents across the galaxy to gather information on this  while Kylo Ren  now Supreme Leader of the First Order  searches for Palpatine in an effort to eliminate all potential threats to his power.He steals an ancient Sith device called a  Wayfinder  from the planet Mustafar  and uses it to navigate the galaxy\'s unknown regions. Soon  he finds Exagol  the mythical home world of the Sith. Sure enough  Palpatine awaits him there  having returned from the dead via unnatural means following Darth Vader\'s betrayal in Return Of The Jedi - though he still needs to be hooked up to machinery operated by a cult-like group of Sith loyalists to stay alive.Palpatine reveals he has been pulling the strings of the First Order this whole time - he created Snoke to act as a puppet leader  and helped tempt Kylo to the Dark Side. Kylo intends to kill Palpatine like he killed Snoke  but the former Emperor reveals that he has spent the last 30 years constructing an entire fleet of Star Destroyers - each with the power of a Death Star. He tells Kylo that he could be the ruler of the new Galactic Empire if he destroys Rey  and ends the Jedi Order. But he also warns Kylo that there is more to Rey\'s story than he may realize...Meanwhile  Finn  Poe Dameron and Chewbacca meet with an informant for the Resistance who tells them that there is a spy in the First Order leaking information. He gives them a message in the form of a data encoder  but squadrons of TIE-Fighters arrive and attack them. Finn  Poe and Chewie are forced to flee in the Millennium Falcon  which takes some damage during their escape  but ultimately manages to get away and destroy a number of its pursuers.On the jungle world Ajan-Kloss  where the Resistance is currently based  Rey is learning the ways of the Force from Leia. She expresses frustration at her inability to communicate with the ghosts of the Jedi who came before  but Leia patiently encourages her young student. During her training session  Rey is startled when she has a shared vision with Kylo Ren  due to their Force connection - flashes of scenes from the previous two movies are shown during this scene. She becomes distracted by the vision  and accidentally drops a tree on BB8.The Falcon returns from its mission. Rey  appalled by the state it\'s in  argues with Poe  who is frustrated that she chooses to stay back at the base training when she\'s the best fighter the Resistance has. Poe then reveals to the rest of the Resistance that their worst fears have been confirmed: Palpatine is back  and in 16 hours  his massive fleet will be unleashed onto the galaxy. This will be what the Sith Lord calls  the Final Order .The Resistance will need to get to Exagol and destroy the fleet before it is released  but C3PO explains that there are no maps leading there. Rey remembers something she read in the Jedi texts from Ahch-To - that Luke had gone on a failed search for a Sith wayfinder (the only other one in existence) sometime before his self-imposed exile. All that is known is that the Wayfinder is somewhere on the desert planet Pasaana. Leia agrees to send Rey there and meet with a contact of hers. Finn  Poe  Chewie  3PO and BB8 insist on coming along. The heroes say their goodbyes - Finn to Rose Tico  3PO to R2D2  and Rey to Leia - before departing in the Falcon.Having repaired his damaged helmet  Kylo Ren convenes a meeting of the First Order council. He informs his Generals that there is a spy in their midst. Generals Hux and Pryde stare at each other accusingly. One General expresses skepticism about Palpatine\'s true intentions behind helping them  but Kylo Force-chokes him and levitates his body aggressively to the ceiling. He then prepares to hunt down Rey with his Knights of Ren.The Falcon lands on Pasaana  and the crew arrive at a vibrant festival. Rey is asked her name by one of the natives  and she replies that she\'s  just Rey . Kylo then reaches out to Rey via the Force and figures out where she is by taking the necklace she was given by the natives of Pasaana. Rey warns her friends that the First Order is coming.The group is then met by Leia\'s contact  who turns out to be none other than Lando Calrissian. He reveals that many years ago  he accompanied Luke on a mission to track down a man named Ochi  who may have had information regarding the location of the second Wayfinder. They found Ochi\'s ship abandoned in the desert  where it remains to this day. Lando chose to remain on Pasaana. He gives the heroes directions to where Ochi\'s ship lies.First Order Stormtroopers arrive  forcing the heroes to flee through the desert. The group ends up sinking through Quicksand  and find themselves in an underground cave where they discover Ochi\'s remains. Next to him is a dagger that 3PO realizes has an inscription written in the ancient language of the Sith. Unfortunately  his programming forbids him from translating it  much to Poe\'s frustration. They are then attacked by a giant creature which Rey realizes is injured  and heals with the Force. The creature tunnels an escape route for them out of gratitude.Outside  they find Ochi\'s ship  but Rey senses that Kylo is near  and goes to hold him off so her friends have time to escape. She damages Kylo\'s TIE-Fighter  but Chewie is captured by the Knights of Ren along with the dagger  and placed on a First Order transport ship. Rey tries to pull the transport towards her with the Force  but Kylo attempts to do the same. Eventually  a burst of Force Lightning unexpectedly shoots from Rey\'s hand  destroying the transport. Rey is devastated that she has seemingly killed Chewie  but escapes in Ochie\'s ship with her friends  while Kylo and his troops steal the Falcon.Finn comforts Rey on the ship  as she is still heartbroken over Chewie. 3PO reveals that he committed the dagger\'s inscription to his memory  and the group figures out that if they could bypass 3PO\'s programming  he could translate it for them. Poe says he knows a black market Droidsmith on the planet Kijimi who might be able to do just that. Meanwhile  BB8 befriends another little droid called D-O on the ship.The group lands on Kijimi  and encounter a Spice Runner named Zorii Bliss  who is revealed to be an old friend (and possibly ex-lover) of Poe\'s. Zorii brings them to Babu Frik  the droidsmith Poe mentioned. Frik says he can bypass 3PO\'s programming  but in doing so  he will have to wipe the droid\'s memory. Despite this  3PO insists on going ahead with it anyway  prepared to sacrifice his memory for the good of the Resistance\'s cause. Frik hacks into 3PO\'s memory  and he translates the inscription  revealing that the other Wayfinder is on the remains of the second Death Star. 3PO then reboots  having lost all his memories. Zorii gives Poe a First Order captain\'s medallion to help them get through the First Order\'s security.The First Order arrives on Kijimi  having tracked the group there. Rey senses that Chewie is alive on their ship  and realizes he must have been on a different transport to the one she destroyed. The heroes agree to use the medallion to get on board the ship and rescue Chewie and the Falcon.On board the ship  the group is separated - Finn and Poe are captured alongside Chewie. Rey comes across the Sith dagger  and touches it  experiencing a vision that reveals Ochi killed her parents. It seems that he had been sent after her  and her parents sold her to keep their daughter safe. Kylo senses that Rey is on board his ship.Finn  Poe and Chewie are about to be executed by the First Order. However  Hux saves them and reveals that he is the spy - he doesn\'t care whether or not the Resistance wins  but he is sabotaging the First Order\'s cause out of spite towards Kylo Ren.Kylo arrives to confront Rey  and finally reveals the truth to her: her father was the son of Palpatine  making her the Emperor\'s granddaughter. He also reveals that they are connected because they are a  dyad  in the Force  and once again tries to convince her to join him. Rey refuses  and escapes on the Falcon with Finn  Poe  Chewie  3PO  BB8 and D-O.General Pryde figures out that Hux was the spy  and kills him. Palpatine then issues an order for Kijimi to be destroyed by one of his Star Destroyers. The First Order is still able to follow the heroes  because they scanned the dagger and translated its inscription before they arrived.The remains of the second Death Star are located on an ocean moon near Endor. There  the group are met by a tribe of ex-Stormtroopers led by a young woman named Jannah. She and Finn bond over having both escaped from the First Order.Rey braves her way through the perilous ocean to make her way to the Death Star. She gets the Wayfinder  then has a vision of herself as a Sith. Kylo then arrives and destroys the Wayfinder  meaning Rey can only reach Exagol if she comes with him. Rey becomes angered  and they begin a lightsaber duel. For a time  it looks like Kylo is winning - but Leia senses the duel back on Ajan-Kloss.Desperate  Leia reaches out to her son through the Force  causing him to hesitate. Rey takes this opportunity to stab Kylo with her lightsaber - but realizes too late that this also affects Leia  since she and Kylo were connected at the time. Rey heals Kylo with the Force  but is unable to save Leia  who dies back at the base. Distraught  and still haunted by the revelation of her true lineage  Rey steals Kylo\'s TIE-Fighter and leaves.She returns to Ahch-To  intending to exile herself there as Luke once did. But when she tries to burn the Skywalker lightsaber  Luke\'s Force Ghost appears and stops her. He tells her that she must not make the same mistake he did  and reveals that Leia knew of her Palpatine lineage all along  but still trained her. He then gives her a lightsaber that was intended for Leia before she gave up her Jedi training because of her pregnancy. Rey remembers that Kylo has the other Wayfinder in his TIE-Fighter and removes it. Luke levitates his X-Wing out of the water (mirroring the scene where Yoda does the same thing in The Empire Strikes Back)  and Rey sets a course for Exagol.Meanwhile  Kylo is more conflicted than ever  and racked with remorse over his mother\'s death. He has a vision of his father  Han Solo  encouraging him to renounce the Dark Side and return to the light. Kylo tosses his lightsaber away  reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo.With Kylo presumed dead  Pryde takes command of the Sith fleet on Exagol  and destroys Kijimi. We also learn that Pryde served Palpatine during the days of the Galactic Empire.Finn  Poe and the others (now accompanied by Jannah) return to Ajan-Kloss  and are informed of Kijimi\'s destruction as well as Leia\'s death. Chewie breaks down and howls in anguish over Leia\'s passing  and Poe is informed that he is to succeed her as General.Poe does not feel that he has what it takes to be the leader Leia was. Lando arrives  and Poe asks him how he  Leia  Han and Luke were able to take on a whole Empire when the odds seemed stacked against them. Lando replies that they had each other  and encourages Poe.R2 backs up 3PO\'s memory  and then starts receiving a signal from Luke\'s X-Wing. Realizing it\'s Rey  and that she is leading them all to Exagol  Poe appoints Finn as his co-General  and prepares to lead a Resistance fleet against Palpatine\'s Star Destroyers. Lando is sent off in the Falcon to gather reinforcements from across the galaxy.Rey arrives on Exagol and confronts Palpatine  who tells her to strike him down  so his spirit may pass into her. He threatens to destroy her friends if she does not. Rey is about to carry out the deed  but senses that Ben has arrived to help her. The two manage to share Leia\'s lightsaber via their Force connection  and take down the Knights of Ren together. Palpatine realizes they are a dyad in the Force  and draws life force from them  rejuvenating himself. He declares that nothing will stop the return of the Sith  and tosses Ben down a nearby chasm  seemingly killing him.The Resistance engages in battle with the First Order\'s fleet  but all seems hopeless  as they are outnumbered and overpowered. Just as Poe thinks the battle is lost  Lando arrives with a massive fleet of ships from across the galaxy. Among the reinforcements are Zorii and Babu Frik (who escaped Kijimi before it was destroyed) and Rebellion veteran Wedge Antilles. Now  the Resistance has their own army capable of taking on the First Order.In Palpatine\'s throne-room  a weakened Rey lies on the floor. Suddenly  she begins to hear the voices of the fallen Jedi reaching out to her - she hears Obi-Wan Kenobi  Anakin Skywalker  Yoda  Qui-Gon Jinn  Mace Windu  Ahsoka Tano  Kanan Jarrus  Aayla Secura  Luminara Unduli  Adi Gallia  and finally  Luke Skywalker  all of whom say that they will stand behind her  and she must rise up to destroy the Emperor and restore balance.Rey gets to her feet  and Palpatine attempts to shoot Force Lighting at her  which she deflects with Leia and Luke\'s lightsabers. Palpatine angrily says that she is powerless to stop him  and declares  I am ALL THE SITH! . Rey responds  and I...am all the Jedi   and deflects the lighting back at her grandfather  disintegrating his body and destroying the lord of the Sith once and for all.The effort drains all life from Rey  and she begins to die. Ben crawls out of the chasm and transfers his life force to Rey  reviving her. They share a kiss before he dies  redeemed just like his grandfather before him.

This comes just after their real-world builder Finn (voice of Jadon Sand) is told by his father (voice of Will Ferrell) that his little sister is now allowed to play with Legos. After the Duplos threatens to destroy the Lego people  Emmet approaches them with a heart that he builds as a peace offering  only for the Duplo leader to eat it. Lucy  AKA Wyldstyle (voice of Elizabeth Banks) tries to attack  but this just makes the alien scream powerfully enough to shatter windows. The Duplos start to rampage across Bricksburg  causing structures to collapse. Emmet and Lucy get help from Batman (voice of Will Arnett)  Unikitty (voice of Alison Brie)  Metalbeard (voice of Nick Offerman)  and Benny (Charlie Day)  but they are outmatched and defeated. Meanwhile  President Business (also Will Ferrell) ditches them to go golfing.Five years later  Bricksburg has become Apocalypseburg  with everyone adjusting to their new city by being dark  brooding  and edgy. Lucy says that the Justice League - Superman (voice of Channing Tatum)  Wonder Woman (voice of Cobie Smulders)  Aquaman (voice of Jason Momoa)  Green Lantern (voice of Jonah Hill)  and Cyborg - went off to fight the Duplos  but they never returned. Batman stayed behind to do a standalone adventure and is now living in a large fortress with Alfred (voice of Ralph Fiennes). Emmet is the only one who retains his cheerful disposition. He joins Lucy with some coffee  but she is too busy brooding. Emmet then mentions having a crazy dream in which he saw a dolphin clock with a time of 5:15  and a black hole opening that swallows all of his friends in an event called  Ourmamageddon . He then shows Lucy that he built them a house just outside of the city  and he brings her over to check it out. While she thinks it\'s nice  she worries it will attract unwanted attention  and she also thinks Emmet is too childish. Her fears are confirmed when a ship descends toward the city and spots Emmet  Lucy  and Unikitty (who is now huge and goes by Ultrakitty). The pilot fires a heart bomb at the trio  who run away after building an escape buggy. However  they are followed because Emmet puts his blinker on.They make it to Batman\'s fortress where they hide from the invader  and Batman attempts to fire at them  but it doesn\'t work. The invader makes her way in and introduces herself as General Sweet Mayhem (Stephanie Beatriz). She seeks out the leader of the group  and Lucy points Emmet out as  The Special . Mayhem disagrees and doesn\'t see anything special about Emmet. She proceeds to kidnap Lucy  Batman  Unikitty  Benny  and Metalbeard and take them with her. Emmet tries to get the other citizens to help him save his friends  but they don\'t want to join him due to him being immature. Emmet sets off on his own to rescue his friends by converting his house into a ship.Mayhem brings the Master Builders to the Systar System where she lives. She takes them to a planet ruled by the shape-shifting Queen Watevra Wa\'Nabi (voice of Tiffany Haddish). Watevra appears like an evil tyrant  but she does her best to persuade the heroes that she is the complete opposite of a villain by singing a song about it. She manages to persuade the others by appealing to their interests (spaceships for Benny  cute stuff for Unikitty  pirate stuff for Metalbeard  and just appealing to Batman\'s ego). Everyone but Lucy is convinced that she can be trusted. Watevra wants to marry Batman and unite their worlds  which startles him.Emmet is making his way through space  only to come across a glassteroid storm. Just before he collides with one  he is saved by the super cool Rex Dangervest (also Chris Pratt)  flying in a ship shaped like a fist. He brings Emmet on-board and introduces himself as a galaxy-defending cowboy/raptor trainer (in other words  Chris Pratt\'s most famous roles). Rex tells Emmet his backstory of how he was left trapped under the dryer in Finn\'s home and was forgotten by his friends  but he managed to pull himself out and become who he is now. He has a whole control center with raptors that he trained. Rex then decides to join Emmet in his quest to save his friends.The Master Builders are brought to Planet Sparkles in preparations for the wedding. Lucy is given a wash  revealing that the black in her hair is painted  and her real hair is blue. Watevra\'s assistants - Ice Cream Cone (voice of Richard Ayoade)  Banarnar (voice of Ben Schwartz)  and Balthazar (voice of Noel Fielding) - try to get Lucy as pumped up as they are by forcing her to listen to the upbeat  Catchy Song . She escapes and finds herself crawling through a vent next to Bruce Willis (voicing himself as a Lego).At the same time  Emmet and Rex appear on the same planet with other Lego Mini-Figures people. Emmet finds everybody to be overly happy and friendly. The Justice League are there  and Superman is now best buds with Green Lantern (whom he couldn\'t stand before) and even Lex Luthor (voice of Ike Barinholtz). They also go along and sing  Catchy Song   which Rex finds painful.Batman and Watevra have a private dinner together. Mayhem scans Batman and detects that he is hiding his insecurities under his ego  which Watevra implies is not unlike her. He admits that he is not looking to get hitched  but Watevra responds that she only said she wanted to marry him to make her real crush jealous. This starts to make Batman walk back on his words  just as Watevra starts to sing a song about why she\'s not into Gotham City guys. Batman relents and makes an official proposal to her.Numerous citizens gather on top of a giant wedding cake for Batman and Watevra\'s wedding. Lucy meets up with Emmet and Rex as they both plan to stop the ceremony by smashing the wedding cake. Rex is suspicious of Lucy and thinks she is brainwashed  but Emmet trusts her. As they proceed with their plan  Lucy runs into Mayhem  and in the confrontation  Mayhem is knocked off a ledge. Her helmet falls off  and her deepened tough voice is gone  and she appears genuinely frightened as she holds on for dear life. She slips but Lucy manages to catch her. Mayhem explains that she and Watevra really aren\'t bad  and that they just wanted to unite their worlds. This leads Lucy to realize that Rex is the true villain  as he is trying to keep everyone apart. Outside  Lucy watches the ceremony and sees Watevra take her true form - the heart that Emmet built all those years earlier for the Duplos. Before Lucy can stop Emmet  he harnesses his  grown-up  power and smashes the cake  which causes everything to fall into ruin and tear open a hole.Everything that happens is a result of the real world where Finn\'s sister Bianca (voice of Brooklynn Prince) has brought Finn\'s Legos into her room so that they can play together  but Finn is a jerk and he breaks Bianca\'s creations. Their mother (voice of Maya Rudolph) comes in and scolds them for fighting  and because the Legos hurt her bare feet  she orders the kids to put the pieces away in a storage bin (the black hole). This makes Emmet\'s nightmare of Ourmamageddon come true  as the kids pick up all the Legos and leave them trapped in the darkness of the storage bin.After Emmet realizes what has happened  Rex tells him the truth - he is Emmet from the future! On his trip to save his friends  Emmet ended up under the dryer and was left alone  just watching Finn play without him. He became bitter and forced himself out of the dryer where he made a new tougher  mature image for himself and shunned all the cute and childish things he once valued. He made himself a time machine using bits from the DeLorean  Bill and Ted\'s phone booth  the Tardis  an H.G. Wells contraption  and a hot tub  and he used it to go back in time to find Emmet before he got lost. Since Emmet doesn\'t agree with his plans  Rex tosses him out of the ship and back under the dryer.Lucy  Mayhem  and the Master Builders all feel sad and sing about how everything is NOT awesome  but this doesn\'t mean that it has to be the end for them. In the real world  Finn realizes that he was rotten to Bianca and remembers how much fun they had playing together when they were younger  and he makes amends with her by bringing her the Watevra heart. Meanwhile  Emmet is stuck under the dryer and attempts to free himself  but he has limited movement down there. Rex joins him to fight and keep him there  but now that Finn and Bianca are playing  Lucy is free and she goes to help Emmet  and they use one of Mayhem\'s heart bombs to defeat Rex. Rex realizes how wrong he was  but now that Lucy has come to save Emmet  it means that Rex won\'t exist. He starts to disappear but bids farewell to Emmet and Lucy. The two are then reunited with their friends.Finn and Bianca combine their worlds so that all the residents now live in harmony. President Business returns from his golf trip but gets kicked out of town almost immediately. Lucy rebuilds her and Emmet\'s home and presents him with a surprise: an original album of  Everything is Awesome . Emmet looks closely and sees Lucy on the cover  and it slowly dawns on him that she was one of the original artists behind the song.' , 'They come in pieces.'  'Everything is more Awesome in Space!'

Anna brings the kids to Rafael's shop to ask for help. Although he appears not interested  he agrees when Sam asks for his help. Rafael goes to their home and uses eggs to determine that there is indeed a powerfully evil entity haunting them. It would not matter where they go  as La Llorona would follow them.Rafael stays with the family at night as they try to find a way to keep La Llorona out.

They meet an informant of Harry\'s  a Mr. Mime who directs them to an underground illegal Pok??mon battle arena. The arena\'s owner  Sebastian  recognizes Pikachu as the Pok??mon who injured his Charizard in a previous battle and demands a rematch.

She and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) witness the birth of a giant larva dubbed Mothra inside the Monarch base (disguised as a Mayan Pyramid). Emma calms Mothra down with the  Orca   a device capable of emitting frequencies that can attract or alter Titan behavior. A group of ecological-terrorists  led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance)  suddenly attack the base and kidnaps Emma and Madison.Mothra flees and pupates under a waterfall. Monarch scientists Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) approach Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler)  Emma\'s ex-husband and Madison\'s father  to track them down. They tell him that the Monarch team is tracking 17 monsters. Mark wants them destroyed but Serizawa believes some of them are benevolent. Serizawa wants Mark\'s help to decode the frequencies Emma combined in the Orca  so that they can track the Orca and hence track Emma and Madison. Mark speculates that Alan is using Mothra as a diversion so that he can concentrate on luring all the 17 monsters.The Monarch team follow Godzilla to Antarctica (Godzilla suddenly rises from his deep slumber in his sea lair and starts travelling towards Antarctica)  where Jonah intends to free a three-headed Titan code-named  Monster Zero . Emma frees and awakens Monster Zero (controlling him with Orca after tuning its frequency to Zero\'s alpha frequency)  which kills several Monarch members  including Dr. Graham  before battling Godzilla. Godzilla is swiftly defeated as its nuclear breath misses its mark and Monster Zero scores several directs hits with its electric lasers on Godzilla.\nThe team realizes that Emma was not kidnapped by the terrorists but was secretly working with them. Emma contacts them and argues that the Titans must be awakened in order to heal the planet from damage that humans have caused. she argues that life sprouted wherever the monsters fought  caused by their radiation.Jonah and Emma awaken Rodan (The Fire Demon) in Mexico. Monarch lures Rodan into fighting the approaching Monster Zero  but Monster Zero swiftly defeats Rodan before being ambushed by Godzilla  who severs one of its heads. During the fight  the Navy launches a prototype missile called the  Oxygen Destroyer   seemingly killing Godzilla. Monster Zero survives  regrows its lost head  and awakens all the other dormant Titans around the world  with Rodan submitting to its rule. Due to this  Madison disowns her mother.Through mythological texts  Dr. Ilene Chen (Zhang Ziyi) discovers that Monster Zero is Ghidorah  an ancient alien seeking to Terraform the Earth. Mothra emerges from her cocoon and flies to Monarch\'s Bermuda base to communicate with Godzilla  who survived the detonation and is recuperating in an ancient underwater city. Via submarine  the team locates Godzilla\'s lair  where the whole area is highly radioactive. They deduce that it will take years for him to heal  and decide to detonate a nuclear warhead to fibrillate him. Dr. Serizawa sacrifices himself (Since the weapons system of the submarine was damaged) by manually detonating the weapon  which revives Godzilla and increases his power.In Boston (In one of Monarch\'s  End of the world  bunkers where they are hiding)  Emma realizes that the destruction Ghidorah and the other Titans will bring to the Earth is far worse than what humans could inflict  but Jonah ignores her pleas. Madison overhears this and steals the Orca. Madison broadcasts a frequency at Fenway Park that calms and unwittingly attracts the Titans to her location. Ghidorah lands in Boston to destroy the Orca  with Godzilla arriving with Monarch\'s assistance to engage it. Mark leads a team to rescue Madison and escape the city after learning that Godzilla\'s radiation levels are increasing and will lead to a thermonuclear explosion. Mothra arrives but is intercepted by Rodan  whom she defeats. Ghidorah overpowers Godzilla and prepares to kill him  but Mothra sacrifices herself and transfers her energy to Godzilla  rapidly healing him. Mark  Emma  and Madison are reunited and reactivate the Orca to lure Ghidorah away from Godzilla. Emma sacrifices herself  giving Mark and Madison time to escape. Godzilla enters a newly empowered state  glowing red and melting everything around him. He defeats Ghidorah with nuclear pulses and disintegrates the last head.

Shortly after defeating the evil entity known as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)  the Losers Club - Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell)  Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor)  Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis)  Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard)  Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer)  Stanley Uris (Wyatt Olef)  and Mike Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs) - gather as Bev tells the boys about the vision she saw of all of them as adults when she faced Pennywise. The Losers make a blood pact to return to Derry in the event that they must face IT once more.27 years later in 2016  a gay couple - Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) - are enjoying a night out at the carnival when they are harassed by homophobic thugs. Even as they walk away from the carnival  the thugs follow them and start to viciously assault them. They throw Adrian over the bridge and flee into the night. Adrian almost drowns until he is pulled out of the water... except the one who pulled him out was Pennywise. Don watches in horror as the monster clown grabs Adrian and takes a huge bite out of his chest. Mike (now played by Isiah Mustafa) overhears a report of the incident over a police scanner  and when he arrives at the scene  he discovers the message  COME HOME  written in blood on the side of the bridge. Mike knows that IT has returned.We catch up with the other Losers in adulthood. Bill (now played by James McAvoy) is married to Audra (Jess Weixler) and has found success as an author/screenwriter  but he is frequently told that his endings are not good. Eddie (now played by James Ransone) is a risk assessor who is married to a woman  Myra (Mollie Atkinson)  who is just as controlling as his own mother. Ben (now played by Jay Ryan) has slimmed down and is a successful architect  though he lives alone. Richie (now played by Bill Hader) is a stand-up comedian. Stanley (now played by Andy Bean) is a partner in an accounting firm. Bev (now played by Jessica Chastain) is a fashion designer  married to the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink). Mike calls everyone  and they do not immediately recognize his voice until he mentions he is from Derry. Everybody becomes slightly unnerved by the phone call  and Mike beckons them to return to Derry. Bev tells Tom that she will be returning to Derry to visit friends  but he is paranoid and thinks she is lying to him and is cheating on him since he heard Mike\'s name. Tom starts to hit Bev until she fights back and runs away from their home. The other guys start to make their way back to Derry. The only one who doesn\'t go is Stanley  as he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the tub rather than facing the nightmare from his childhood again.A flashback shows that psychotic bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived being pushed down the well by Mike and had washed out of the sewers. When he returned home  police arrested him after they came across the body of Henry\'s father and deduced that he murdered him. Today  Henry (now played by Teach Grant) is in a mental institution and has become even more insane. He is visited by Pennywise in the form of a zombified Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague)  who presents Henry with his old knife.The Losers meet at the Jade of the Orient restaurant and catch up after a long absence. They joke and reminisce  but also note Stanley\'s absence. They start to split fortune cookies  only to each get single word fortunes that they realize form a full message. Bev\'s fortune reads  Stanley   and put together  the fortunes read  Guess Stanley Could Not Cut It . The Losers know that Pennywise has found them. The fortune cookies then start to crack open and reveal hideous little spider-like creatures. The Losers bash at them on the table  which only makes them look crazy when others see them attacking a table. Outside the restaurant  Bev calls Stanley\'s wife. Before she can say what happened  Bev knows that Stanley was found in a bathtub  and the other guys figure what happened to him.Everyone gathers at the hotel where they are staying  and Mike confesses that this is the real reason he summoned everyone back to Derry. They ask Bev how she knew how Stanley died  and she says she has seen how they all die  as she was the only one who saw the Deadlights when Pennywise captured her. Bill goes back to Mike\'s house  where Mike drugs Bill\'s water to cause him to experience a trippy vision. Mike explains that in all the time he has stayed in Derry  he has studied the history of IT and learned from a Native American tribe of the Ritual of Chud  which can be performed to destroy IT once and for all. He produces a ritualistic piece of pottery with a depiction of the ritual. They bring it back to the other Losers  and Mike explains that they need to gather artifacts from their childhood and place it in the pottery so that they can destroy Pennywise.Somewhere else in Derry  we see a little girl named Victoria (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) at a football game with her mom. Victoria is lured away by a firefly  and she follows it under the bleachers until she meets Pennywise. He uses the same manipulative trick on her to make her think he is playful  and he appeals to her sympathy when he cries about not having friends  as Victoria is made fun of for a birthmark on her cheek. Pennywise promises to make it go away  only to end up devouring Victoria.The Losers go to an old clubhouse that Ben built for them over the summer they all became friends. There  they find an artifact for Stanley  which is a shower cap. A flashback shows them as kids with Stanley asking if they will all remain friends as adults. His friends assured him that they would be.The gang splits up as they head back to their homes in Derry. Bev goes to her old home and meets the elderly Mrs. Kersh (Joan Gregson). She invites Bev inside for tea and cookies as Bev looks around. She finds an old pack of cigarettes  as well as the poem that Ben wrote for her  although she still thinks it was written by Bill. As Bev sits with Mrs. Kersh  the old woman displays unusual behavior. Bev notices what looks like rotted flesh on Mrs. Kersh\'s chest. She mentions to Bev that her father joined the circus. Bev sees what looks like a human Pennywise in an old picture. Mrs. Kersh then asks Bev if she is  daddy\'s little girl   as her father had called her. The old woman is then revealed to be Pennywise as she takes on a grotesque and monstrous form that chases Bev out. Before Bev gets away  she sees Pennywise in his human form as  Bob Gray   who wears his clown makeup and scratches the red lines on his face to taunt Bev.Richie goes to an old arcade he went to as a kid where he picks up a token as his artifact. In a flashback  he is seen playing a game with Henry\'s cousin  and the bully teases Richie for being a  fairy . Adult Richie is then found and tormented by Pennywise  who claims to know his  dirty little secret.  He takes on the form of a Paul Bunyan statue and tries to attack Richie  but he gets away in time.Bill goes to an antique shop and sees that his old bike is on sale. He asks the shop owner (played by none other than Stephen King) if he can buy the bike. The owner knows of Bill\'s work  but agrees that his endings suck. Bill gets the bike and rides around his old street  passing the sewer where Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was taken. Pennywise taunts Bill with an apparition of Georgie calling to him from the sewers. Bill is almost lured in by the monster clown. As he rides away  he sees a kid named Dean (Luke Roessler)  whom the gang had seen at the restaurant because he is a fan of Richie\'s stand-up. Dean has also seen Pennywise lately after Bill had mentioned it. He firmly orders Dean to get himself and his family out of Derry as soon as possible.Ben gets an old yearbook page  in which Bev was the only one to write for him. He is haunted by a flashback to his childhood where Pennywise took on Bev\'s form to ridicule Ben for his weight  as Pennywise knew that Ben loved Bev  and he still harbors feelings for her to this day. Her form\'s head took fire as Ben hid in a locker  only for Pennywise to be in there with him.Eddie goes to the pharmacy where he would pick up his medications. Creepy Mr. Keene (Joe Bostick) and Gretta (Juno Rinaldi) still work there. Eddie gets an inhaler before he is haunted by Pennywise in the form of his mother being attacked by the Leper (Javier Botet).Henry kills a guard and escapes the institution. He finds the Losers and attacks Eddie by stabbing him in the cheek. He manages to pull the knife out and stab Henry in the chest  albeit non-fatally  and he runs to his friends for help. However  Henry gets away again before he is caught.In another Pennywise haunting  Bill sees the message  The fun is just beginning  written  which is what Dean said to Richie at the restaurant  itself a line from Richie\'s stand-up. Bill knows that Pennywise is referring to Dean  and he goes to a carnival to try and save the boy after learning he will be there. Bill follows Dean into a hall of mirrors  but Dean just thinks Bill is a crazy weirdo. The two are then found by Pennywise  who bares his long tongue and razor-sharp teeth. Bill desperately tries to kick the glass out to save Dean  but Pennywise breaks through first and brutally attacks the boy  blocking Bill\'s view. Bill can only watch in horror as he fails to save the boy.Mike is in the library where Henry finds him and attacks him. Not long after  Richie comes and kills Henry by stabbing him in the back of the head. This causes Richie to puke.Bill reunites with his friends and vows to kill IT himself. His friends gather their artifacts and they join him at the Neibolt House to face off the evil entity for the last time. While there  they make it into Pennywise\'s lair and use the pottery to begin the ritual. The Losers throw in their artifacts  being Bev\'s poem  Ben\'s yearbook page  Richie\'s token  Eddie\'s inhaler  the boat that Bill helped make with Georgie  and a rock that Mike recovered from their rock war with the Bowers gang. The Deadlights appear and sink into the pottery with the artifacts  but just when it seems that things worked  out rises a red balloon that produces Pennywise. He faces the Losers again in his true form  as a monstrous spider that still carries his clown face  and he states how he has waited so long to see them again. Mike then reveals that the ritual never worked  and the tribe that attempted it on Pennywise got killed themselves. He splits the Losers up with more nightmare visions  including one of Stanley\'s severed head as a spider.Eddie and Richie find themselves in a similar scenario to when they were kids as Pennywise places three doors with  Scary    Very Scary   and  Not Scary At All  for them to walk through. They see the severed half of Betty Ripsom\'s body  as well as a small Pomeranian that morphs into a monster. Meanwhile  Ben and Bev are trapped and split from each other  and Pennywise tries to kill Ben by having him sink into the earth while Bev is trapped in an illusion of a bathroom stall where he is harassed by the forms of Mr. Keene  Gretta  Henry  and her own father. Bev fights back against the visions and manages to pull Ben out from sinking  and she realizes he is the one who wrote her the poem as he had recited it as he was almost dying.Bill is trapped in what looks like his childhood basement. He sees his young self talking to Georgie  as the image of the little boy blames Bill for lying on the day that he died  as Bill had pretended to be sick so he wouldn\'t go out to play with Georgie in the rain. This had haunted Bill for years  and Pennywise knew he blamed himself for it. Young Bill goes to his adult self with a nail gun  but Adult Bill forgives himself and shoots the apparition instead.The Losers get close enough to fight Pennywise  with Eddie managing to muster up the courage to strike Pennywise himself. As he runs to Richie  however  Pennywise impales Eddie with one of his talons. The Losers try to seek a way out of there  and they figure that since Pennywise is a spider  he can make himself small to try and go after them. They then quickly realize that the only way to make him small enough to defeat him is to force him to believe he is small. They begin to yell at Pennywise and call out all of his otherwise harmless forms before he starts to shrink and shrivel into a powerless shell of his former self. This allows the Losers to pull his heart out of his chest and crush it  destroying him for good. The lair begins to crumble and collapse around them. Richie tries to get Eddie out  but he is already dead. The Losers escape the house and watch as it collapses on itself.The remaining five head to the quarry where they all swam as children. They think about Eddie and how he would have hated it since it\'s so dirty. Richie then starts to cry for his fallen friend  and the others console him. As they continue to swim  Ben and Bev share a kiss. As they later walk home  they see their reflections on a window and see their childhood selves  including Eddie and Stanley.

His mother has died after an explosion during a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. He feels he is responsible for the death of his mother. The whereabouts of his father are unknown. He has given the police the name of a mother  Samantha Barbour  whose family he knows from school. The woman agrees to take responsibility of him as an obligation since no one in Theo\'s family is available. He is clearly emotionally devastated  but shows no sign of crying. Police repeatedly ask him questions about his location  his mother\'s location  who and what else he has seen around the time of the explosion  etc. The woman stands up for him and his apparent lack of memory. Theo goes home with the mother. He makes good friends with Andy  the curly-haired son who is just under his age. The family is somewhat dysfunctional  especially visible in incidents involving the strong-willed father and the impudent oldest son  Platt.We learn that Theo had received a ring from a man killed in the blast. He was asked to return it to Hobart and Blackwell. Theo resourcefully finds the address of Hobart and Blackwell in the phone book and ventures out to deliver the ring. He is invited in and develops a friendship with the antique dealer  Hobie  who had lost his business partner Welty in the blast. Hobie is taking care of Pippa  the red-haired daughter of Welty Blackwell who Theo admired immediately before the blast. Pippa has major head injuries and spends most of her time in bed and is discouraged from listening to music since she needs rest more than music practice. Pippa and Theo have a strong bond since both just lost the main part of their families in the explosion. Pippa\'s mother had already passed away prior to the explosion due to illness.Theo spends time at both the Barbour family and the Hobie\'s shop and home. He learns about antique restoration from Hobie. He develops stronger ties to Andy and Mrs. Barbour. Theo is invited to join them for their summer vacation. However  soon after that invitation  Theo\'s father shows up along with his girlfriend. Theo disappointedly is required to travel off to live with his father  Larry  and the father\'s girlfriend  Xandra  in a mostly foreclosed neighborhood at the edge of the desert. Life is lonely at the new school and in the neighborhood  until Theo meets another loner named Boris. Boris is an awkward classmate who has lived many places as his father is a miner. Boris has no mother and his father is typically away. This allows plenty of time for Boris to shoplift  experiment with drugs  and get into other mischief. Some of these habits are adopted by Theo as well.Through flashbacks  we learn that Theo immediately after the explosion had been encouraged by Welty to take the valuable painting  The Goldfinch  as Welty was dying. Theo had kept it wrapped up  sporadically hugging it as it was a source of comfort  his mother\'s favorite painting  and the last art he had seen before his life was radically changed. It becomes more and more clear that Theo\'s life all began its downward spiral right at the moment of that terrible explosion.Larry happens to be in serious debt trouble and attempts to get Theo to transfer $65 000 out of the inheritance from his mother. The plan fails as the money can only be transferred directly to a school. Larry is in despair and ends up getting extremely drunk and killing himself in an auto accident. Theo and Boris learn of the father\'s death during one of their drug trips. Soon after  Theo decides that he must leave before he is assigned to a foster home. He heads back to New York and moves in with Hobie.The next scene shows Theo after a few years have passed  and we see Theo as a young man -- no longer a boy. Hobie has taught Theo about antique restoration and Theo joins Hobie\'s company  working as the sales arm of Hobart and Blackwell. His assistance leads to increased financial success  although it becomes clear that sometimes Theo is selling the reproductions as authentic antiques and not just as stated  high-quality reproductions of antiques as Hobie had intended.A dissatisfied customer complains to Theo that he had been tricked during his purchase of furniture that was offered to him as an authentic. To further avoid trouble  Theo offers to buy it back even beyond the purchase price. However  the customer actually knows far more  has done extensive research  and announces that he knows that Theo had taken  The Goldfinch . Theo does not let on that he took it or has it. Tensions are high and the customer later divulges his knowledge to the highly honest Hobie. Hobie confronts Theo about the new information  and Theo regretfully confesses to a much disappointed Hobie that the claim is true.Other tragedies have occurred. Andy and his father had passed away during a storm on the open seas  and this has hit Mrs. Barbour hard. As for Theo\'s love life: Theo\'s true love  Pippa is committed to another man. Theo has therefore focused his affection for the now grown-up daughter  Kitsey  of Mrs. Barbour. However  Theo finds that even while engaged  Kitsey has been and remains romantically involved with another man who she loves -- clearly not to the liking of Theo.In coping with the continued tragedies  Theo continues his drug habits  and this once again brings him by chance in contact with the now grown-up Boris. Boris is more wealthy now and has his own driver. Boris confesses that he had actually taken the painting  The Goldfinch  years ago from Theo. Theo had last opened it up during one of their drug trips  of which Theo had no recall. Boris had actually during the high-school days  secretly taken the painting and unbeknownst to Theo  replaced it with a Civics book.Since then  the painting was truly lost and out of the country  no longer in Boris\'s possession. However  Boris had a plan to get it back  to set things right again between him and Theo. The plan involved money and guns and dealing with professional crooks and did not go well. The painting was again lost. Theo was now at the bottom of his spiral  took a lethal dose of drugs and began hallucinating. Just then  Boris rushes into the hotel room  forces Theo to vomit the drugs out and returns Theo back to life. Boris also had served as an informant about the missing painting and delivers Theo the news that the police have finally found  The Goldfinch  and have returned it to its rightful place in the museum. The movie allows one to wonder after his second chance if Theo can overcome and achieve the life to eventually surmount the terrible event.' , 'The Story of a Stolen Life'

Their boss  Frank Minna (Bruce Willis)  found them when they were being raised in the orphanages and rescued them  and now they all work for him. Lionel is kind and smart  but also plagued by Tourette\'s syndrome which makes him seem strange and as such he leads a fairly isolated life. But alongside his Tourette\'s also come things like perfect recall and memory which make him good at detective work.Frank has been at work on a secret job and is taking a big  secret meeting for it - he asks Lionel and Gilbert to shadow him in case it goes south. Lionel listens over the phone as Frank presents some important information that is threatening some sort of big deal to a group of men - William Lieberman (Josh Pais)  Lou (Fisher Stevens)  and an extremely large henchman. They ask Frank where the original copies are  and Frank tries to negotiate a high price for them  so the men drag him out to force him to take them to the originals. Lionel and Gilbert follow in their car  and arrive just in time to see Frank being shot. He tells them he led the goons on a goose chase and made a run for it - they take him to the hospital but it\'s too late  and Frank dies.Frank\'s widow Julia (Leslie Mann) leaves Tony in charge of the office. Lionel  determined to find out what Frank was working on and who killed him  begins wearing Frank\'s hat and coat and starts investigating. He finds a matchbox in Frank\'s coat pocket and goes to check out an African-American bar. Piecing together a few of the words he heard on the phone call  he realizes that whatever Frank found  it involved Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)  a young woman working for Gabby Horwitz (Cherry Jones). Gabby and Laura are fighting gentrification in the city - poor and minority neighborhoods are being bought out and demolished and their inhabitants forced out of the city. Lionel goes to a council meeting and sees Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin)  who the city folk blame for this problem. He\'s the one in charge of development and built half the parks in New York City. Lionel steals a reporter\'s credentials and begins asking questions - a man named Paul (Willem Dafoe) who rampaged against Moses in the meeting gives Lionel some tips.Lionel follows Laura and under the guise of reporting on the gentrification story gets to know her and about the situation. She takes him to the club that Frank was looking into and the two have a dance. Her father (Robert Wisdom)  assuming that Lionel is one of Randolph\'s men  has his men beat Lionel unconscious - a trumpet player at the club (Michael K. Williams)  rescues Lionel and lets him stay at his apartment. Lionel continues researching  and discovers that Paul is Moses\'s brother  and also that Lieberman is getting kickbacks on so many of the housing deals. He also realizes that the housing relocation programs are scams. Meanwhile  Paul  an engineer who is desperately trying to help the city and has been nearly cut off by his unethical brother  presents Moses with a huge renovation plan that will help the city greatly.Lionel gets a call from Laura\'s father  apologizing for the attack and saying he now knows he was one of Frank\'s men and he has information for him  but when Lionel goes to meet him at the club  he\'s been murdered and staged like a suicide. Laura finds him and is distraught  and so Lionel stays the night in her apartment to keep her company. He admits the truth about who he is and that he just wants justice for his friend Frank  and he believes her to be in danger. He tells her that Frank always called him  Motherless Brooklyn . When Lionel finds photos of Paul meeting with Laura\'s father  he confronts her - she explains that her  Uncle  Paul is her real father  and that she suspected this but they never told her officially. Lionel goes to Paul  and tells him he suspects that this information somehow is trouble for Moses  and he can\'t believe that he would put Laura\'s life in danger. Paul says that he did no such thing  that Frank and Laura\'s father had the idea to get more money out of Randolph\'s goons and he told them not to. He begs Lionel to find the evidence.Randolph\'s goons summon Lionel to meet with Moses. He tells Lionel to join his team and stop snooping  and gives him 24 hours to decide. Lionel eventually puts the pieces together and realizes that inside Frank\'s hat is the key to a safe deposit box. Inside is the deed to a building  and Laura\'s birth certificate: Moses is her father  not Paul. He gives the key to Paul and runs into Tony  who has been working for Randolph doing surveillance. They get a drink  and Tony admits he\'s been sleeping with Julia. He tells Lionel to take the deal  since Laura is about to be killed anyway. Lionel throws hot water in Tony\'s face and races to save Laura. He stops her just before she enters her apartment  and the two flee and eventually get the upper hand on the assassins: Laura knocks the large one off the fire escape  and Lou corners them with a gun but is hit over the head by the trumpet player  who had witnessed Lionel running in. Lionel has him drive Laura out of town.Lionel meets with Moses  and asks for his side of the story. Moses raped Laura\'s mother  an employee  and this information threatened to destroy everything. Paul signed off on the birth certificate because he\'s a man of morals. Moses wants to know what Lionel wants - for him to stop his latest leveling of a poor neighborhood? But Lionel says all his wants is Laura to be left alone  or he will release the information. He also tells him that Lieberman is on the take  and tells Moses that when he takes Lieberman out  to tell him it\'s for Frank. Moses tells Lionel to tell Paul that his plans are incredible and there\'s no reason to deny them.The next day  Moses denies Paul\'s plans anyway out of spite. Lionel drives out to the property that Frank left him in the deed  where Laura is waiting for him.' ,nan

The man knows that whenever Azzie goes into someone\'s room and sits on their bed  it\'s because Azzie knows that person is going to die.

They take him to a secluded area where they pin him down and brutally murder him  feasting on his dying screams. Abra senses the murder and begins screaming in her home  crying to her parents that the boy has been killed. Rose is able to sense Abra\'s presence there as well  referring to her as a  looker.  At this time  Dan sees  REDRUM  written on his wall. He asks Abra  Who   and she writes back  Baseball Boy.  The True Knot then buries Bradley in a shallow grave.Abra does some research into Bradley\'s disappearance. At school  she is able to hear the thoughts of her classmates. When she gets home to her room  she has visions of the True Knot and their whereabouts. She looks outside her window and floats briefly as she is connected to Rose  who is at a supermarket. Rose manages to see Abra and come into contact with her  but Abra expels Rose from her head  which causes a strong enough push to send Rose across the floor. She is amazed by this power  but also threatened by it. Rose brings this information back to Crow  stating that her shine might be too powerful for the True Knot  and so they must destroy her.Dan and Abra eventually find each other and explain their gifts to one another  which Dan calls  The Shining   or  Tony  since he thought it was like having an imaginary friend.

She snaps back to her regular body and sees her injury followed her. She reports to the others that Abra set a trap for her  and so it is now clear that she has to be killed. Crow then informs Rose that Grampa Flick is  cycling.  Too weakened to keep going  he convulses until he decays  and the cult absorbs his steam.Abra makes contact with Dan again and asks for his help in finding Bradley\'s body since she can locate the cult if she touches his baseball glove. With Billy\'s help  Dan is guided by Abra to the site where the boy\'s body is buried. Dan and Billy dig up the body  horrified and physically repulsed at the discovery. They take the glove back to Abra\'s house  but Dave has learned about Abra\'s contact with  Uncle Dan  and thinks Dan is some kind of creep. After explaining everything to Dave and revealing their powers to him  Abra manages to track the cult and deduces their destination.Dan and Billy go into the woods to bait the cult using Abra  who is appearing from her kitchen. Dan and Billy hide and begin shooting at the cult members  and Rose feels the pain as each of them are killed off one by one.

Together  they cause Crow to steer into a tree  and since he wasn\'t wearing his seat belt  he\'s ejected through the windshield and is killed instantly.Dan drives up and locates Abra. They then drive off to make their last stand at the now rundown and condemned Overlook Hotel. Dan walks through the building where his lifelong trauma was born. He finds Room 237  still with the ax markings left by Jack. Dan walks to the mezzanine and meets the bartender  Lloyd (Henry Thomas)  who bears a striking resemblance to Jack  though he insists he is just Lloyd. Dan recounts how Wendy died when he was 20  and how he knew she was dying due to the flies that he would see around anyone who was close to death. Lloyd then drops the facade and channels Jack before downing the drink he offered Dan. Rose soon arrives  and Dan and Abra team up to trap Rose in the icy hedge maze. Abra manages to wound Rose by cutting her legs  but Rose overpowers them and breaks free. Abra runs while Dan faces Rose. She gets into his mind and sees all the fear and trauma he endured in that hotel  which allows her to start absorbing his shine. Rose then sees the boxes of the Overlook spirits and thinks they contain more power  but Dan instead unleashes them to use against Rose. The Grady Twins  Bathtub Lady  and other spirits surround Rose and consume her shine  destroying her for good. But they soon turn their attention to Dan and possess him. He finds Abra  but she is able to tap in and reach Dan  saying he made a stop to the boiler room.

In 2009  his latest target is Betty McLeish (Helen Mirren)  a former history professor at Oxford who lost her husband a year ago and has savings in excess of ??2 million.Feigning a bad knee  Roy manipulates Betty into allowing him to stay at her house. He steadily encourages her to open a joint offshore investment account with him  so that he can steal her money. Simultaneously  Roy and Vincent run an investment scam with their mark Bryn (Mark Lewis Jones) and his associate by employing fake Russian investors (Roy pretends to  invest  200K pounds and the fame Russian investor puts in 800K pounds  to encourage Bryn to part with his funds to the tune of 400K pounds  with a promise of quick doubling of the money). One of the fake Russians  actually a Polish butcher  demands a greater cut of the take; in response  Roy orders thugs to break the butcher\'s hand with a meat tenderizer. Realizing he has been robbed  Bryn follows Roy during his date with Betty. Upon spotting Bryn nearby  Roy sends Betty into the shops before luring Bryn into Charing Cross tube station. There  Roy subdues Bryn by stabbing and then shoving him into the path of an incoming train  killing him instantly. Roy flees and reunites with Betty back at the shops.Roy and Betty vacation in Berlin  where Roy appears to understand German  though he claims he does not. Betty\'s grandson Steven (Russell Tovey) then takes the couple to a flat that Roy recognizes and Steven reveals that \'Roy Courtnay\'-a young British Army officer-was killed there in 1948 by a Nazi war criminal whom he was tracking  according to Soviet records. This causes Roy to explain that his real name is Hans Taub (Laurie Davidson)  who was Roy\'s German translator  and that he stole Roy\'s identity so that he could leave Germany and reinvent himself. Betty accepts his explanation and dismisses Steven\'s objections.Soon afterwards  Roy and Betty plan to transfer their money into the joint account. Vincent suggests to Roy that he leave at least some of the money for Betty to help with her medical condition  but Roy dismisses the idea and insists that he\'ll leave Betty financially defrauded just like his previous victims. Vincent reluctantly complies and later observes the couple transferring their money into the joint account.

Her real name is Lili and she and Roy have met before as German teenagers in 1943  when Hans was tutoring her in English. On their last session  Hans sexually assaulted Lili (Hans wanted to have sex with Lili\'s older sisters  but they made fun of him and insulted him  so he took his revenge on Lili). After her parents dismissed Hans from continuing his tutoring lessons  he denounced Lili\'s father as a traitor and he was executed by the Nazis. This drove Lili\'s mother to commit suicide. Later  Lili\'s sisters were killed in an explosion just two weeks before the death of Adolf Hitler. After the war ended  Lili made her way to England.After recounting on their past  Lili explains to Roy that she has been fully aware of his plan to con her all along. Steven  who was in fact the boyfriend of Lili\'s real grandson Michael  tracked Roy/Hans\' criminal history and they confirmed his identity in a DNA test using a locket from Betty/Lili\'s childhood that contained a piece of Hans\' hair. She also reveals that Vincent has betrayed Roy after being confronted with her knowledge of their crimes.Betty takes all of Roy\'s money out of their joint account  leaving him only enough money to pay back the victims of his earlier con. Just as she prepares to leave the house  Roy locks the door and attacks her - but she manages to fend him off before he is confronted by Bryn\'s associate and the Polish butcher whom he previously cheated. Betty then leaves the house as Roy  refusing to pay his clients back  is consequently beaten up.

At the Atlanta Journal-Constitution  crime reporter Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde) is also assigned to cover it  despite her reluctance.Night one of the concerts goes fine  though Richard is overly cautious and suspicious of every backpack or person acting strangely. He\'s able to bring Bobi and they get to watch Kenny Rogers perform together. The next day  Richard wakes up with the runs and almost calls out sick  but doesn\'t. Richard sees some teens throwing glass bottles  and shoos them away  then afterwards sees a backpack under a bench they were near. Meanwhile  a man makes a 911 call and tells them that a bomb is going to go off at the park. Richard  suspicious  alerts the police about the bag  who initially think he\'s being ridiculous  but eventually agree to follow protocol.

His supervisor tells him now they need to just find the bomber and stop him.The FBI receives a call from Cleere  and so he and his partner Bennet (Ian Gomez) go to talk to him. Cleere tells him he suspects Richard could have done this  since he always wanted to be a hero and wanted this kind of attention. The FBI realizes Richard fits a profile of the  hero bomber  which they have seen multiple cases of - someone who creates terror so they can be a hero. Richard\'s record of being fired and having complaints against him is suspicious  as is the fact that in his interviews he said how he wants to be back in law enforcement.The FBI sends one of Richard\'s cop friends in with a wire to have dinner with him  and Richard talks all about how the bomb could have been made  which makes them suspicious. Meanwhile  while Tom is drinking at a bar  Kathy approaches him to get scoop on the bomber. He denies to offer her anything  but she flirts and tells him she\'ll sleep with him. He tells her Richard is the suspect and they leave to go have sex. Kathy fights to convince her editor to print the story that the FBI is investigating Richard  and he relents.

They tell Richard that they are shooting a training video to try to trick him into waiving his Miranda rights  but Richard picks up on it and asks to speak to a lawyer  angering the FBI. He calls Watson  leaving multiple messages. Watson\'s girlfriend and assistant Nadya (Nina Arianda) gets the messages and pushes Watson to call the FBI right away.

Teaming with Eva Ansley  he founds the Equal Justice Initiative  then travels to a prison to meet its death row inmates. He meets Walter  Johnny D.  McMillian  an African-American man who was convicted of the 1986 murder of Ronda Morrison  a white woman. Stevenson looks over the evidence in the case and discovers it hinges entirely on the testimony of convicted felon Ralph Myers  who provided highly self-contradictory testimony in exchange for a lighter sentence in his own pending trial.Stevenson\'s first move is to ask prosecutor Tommy Chapman for aid; Chapman dismisses him without even looking at Stevenson\'s notes. Stevenson then asks McMillian\'s family friend Darnell Houston to testify that he was with a witness who corroborated Myers\' testimony the day of the murder  which would cause the prosecution\'s case to fall apart. When Stevenson submits Houston\'s testimony  police arrest him for perjury. While Stevenson is able to get the perjury charges dismissed  Houston is intimidated into refusing to testify in court. Shortly afterwards  Stevenson is intimidated by two sheriff deputies who remove him from his car at gunpoint and illegally search the car. They refuse to tell him why he was pulled over and let him go.Stevenson then approaches Myers himself  who eventually admits that his testimony was coerced after police played to his fear of being burned and threatened to have him executed by electric chair. Stevenson appeals to the local court to grant McMillian a retrial and successfully convinces Myers to recant his testimony on the stand  but the judge nevertheless refuses to grant a retrial. Distraught  Stevenson vents his frustrations about the case to Ansley. He appears on 60 Minutes to rally public support in favor of McMillian  and then appeals to the Supreme Court of Alabama. The Supreme Court overturns the circuit court\'s decision  and grants McMillian his retrial. Stevenson then moves to have the charges dismissed entirely. He confronts Chapman at his home and tries to convince him to join him in his motion; Chapman angrily ejects him from his property. The day of the motion comes  and Stevenson appeals to the judge. Chapman agrees to join him in his motion  the case is dismissed  and McMillian is finally reunited with his family.An epilogue notes that Stevenson and Ansley continue to fight for justice to the present day. Until his death in 2013  McMillian remained friends with Stevenson. A follow-up investigation into Morrison\'s death confirmed McMillian\'s innocence and posited that a white man was likely responsible; the case has never been solved. McMillian\'s former cellmate  Anthony Ray Hinton  remained on death row for 28 years until Stevenson was able to have all charges dropped and Hinton was eventually released in 2015.' , 'Every generation has its hero.

Young Natalie (Alex Kis) is watching Pretty Woman and enjoying it until her mother (Jennifer Saunders) comes in and tells her she shouldn't watch romantic comedies because women like her and Natalie don't get happy endings the way beautiful women like Julia Roberts do. This breaks Natalie's spirit and causes her to enjoy the movie less.25 years later  Natalie (now played by Rebel Wilson) works as an architect in New York City. She is kind of a pushover amongst her coworkers and is frequently viewed as (in her eyes  anyway) the 'coffee bitch'. Her only friends are Josh (Adam Devine) and Whitney (Betty Gilpin)  the latter being Natalie's assistant. They receive a new client  handsome billionaire Blake (Liam Hemsworth)  and as Natalie goes to join them for a presentation  Blake mistakes Natalie's coffee for his  and her boss makes her go grab Blake a fresh one. Later  Natalie catches Whitney watching The Wedding Singer and crying. Natalie chastises her and goes on a cynical three-hour rant about why romantic comedies are bullshit and why they set bad examples with their cliches. Josh later tries to invite Natalie to hang out  but she rudely brushes him off  and Whitney tells Natalie that more people would notice her if she were more open.Natalie takes the subway home when she sees a guy on the other train trying to get her attention. They meet up  and he appears friendly  but he then attacks Natalie and tries to take her bag. They fight for it  and she ends up disabling him  but as she runs away  Natalie runs face-first into a pole  knocking herself unconscious.Natalie wakes up in a hospital and is greeted by a good-looking doctor who starts flirting with her. She is more creeped out than charmed  and she leaves after being discharged. When she walks out  she notices that New York doesn't smell like crap and instead smells like lavender. Natalie walks into the street and gets hit by Blake's limo. He is now more charming to her and he takes her home in a matter of seconds and leaves her his number by writing them on flower petals and then expecting Natalie to remember despite him giving them to her in a random order.. She goes into her apartment and finds that it is larger  nicer  and that she owns every shoe ever made  and that they fit her perfectly. Her dog is also well-groomed and obedient now. Also  her grumpy neighbor Donny (Brandon Scott Jones) is now a wildly flamboyant stereotypical gay best friend.At work  Natalie finds that Whitney doesn't work for her and is now in competition with her. Everything just seems weirder to Natalie. She steps out for a walk with Josh  and as they go through the park  they see a woman choking. Josh goes to help her  and she turns out to be a gorgeous swimsuit model named Isabella (Priyanka Chopra)  the same model from a billboard outside Natalie's office that she thinks Josh is always gawking at. There appears to be an instant spark between them  and they go out together  leaving Natalie alone. As she walks around by herself and randomly trips on things while strange handsome men compliment her  in addition to the random people dancing in the park  Natalie comes to the conclusion that she is in a PG-13 romantic comedy.Natalie goes around trying to undo everything and knock herself unconscious again. This just creeps out other guys  and as Natalie attempts to step in front of a train  she is pulled back by a cop who is literally named Officer Hansom. He arrests her for having not paid her fare  and she uses her one phone call to contact Blake  and the petals magically align themselves properly so that Natalie can know the right way to call him. Blake picks her up  and Natalie figures that she has to get him to fall in love with her in order to get herself out of the Rom-com world.After doing an off screen makeover montage with Donny  Natalie goes on a date with Blake looking glammed up. It goes well  ending with a romantic kiss in the middle of a city street. When the two go back to his place to get intimate  it immediately cuts to the next morning. Natalie tries two more times to have sex with Blake and actually experience it  but it keeps cutting over and jumping to the next day. Blake then tells Natalie that he loves her  but it doesn't change anything for her and she is still stuck in the Rom-com.Natalie is later visited by Josh with some Chinese food. The two laugh and joke together  actually having genuine chemistry together. However  it gets ruined when Blake shows up and acts like a dick to Josh  which makes him leave.Natalie and Blake run into Josh and Isabella  and the latter two invite the former two to Isabella's place in the Hamptons for a party they are having. Natalie and Blake head up there  where Natalie and Josh take another stroll together  indicating that Natalie is actually falling for Josh. This is ruined moments later when Josh and Isabella announce that they are getting married the following day. Everyone then heads over to a nearby bar for karaoke. Natalie goes up to sing 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'  but a waitress accidentally unplugs the mic. Natalie keeps the song going and gets help from others  turning it into a full-blown musical number.In the morning  Natalie finds that Blake is trying to pass off her ideas as his own. He defends it by saying that she won't have to work when she's with him  but she likes being an architect and she breaks up with Blake. Upset  she goes to talk to Donny  who gives her some inspiring words based on his own personal experiences. Natalie then realizes that if she loves Josh  she has to go do the ultimate Rom-com cliche of stopping a wedding in slow motion. Natalie gets to the church and gives a big speech to Josh  thinking she will admit she loves him after telling him why he should be with her instead  but she has come to realize that she loves herself  and that is the lesson she was supposed to learn. Natalie leaves the wedding and decides to steal the brand new car Josh and Isabella would have driven  but she is distracted and drives head-first into a wall.Natalie wakes up in another hospital and sees that the doctor there is also a stud  and she fears she is still stuck in the Rom-com world. However  the real doctor (an older man) comes in and makes the other guy leave  as he is just an actor preparing for a role. Natalie pulls a needle out of her arm and yells out 'Fuck!' which leads her to figure out she is back to her reality. She runs home and is happy to see her lousy apartment and lame dog. Outside  she finds that Donny actually is gay in real life  and that he is a weed dealer  leading Natalie to hug him. She returns to work and reaffirms her friendship with Whitney  but makes it clear that she has to stop watching movies at work. She then goes to deliver a presentation to her boss and Blake for a parking garage for a hotel that Blake is set to open. He likes Natalie's pitch  and it appears that the boss does too. Natalie then goes over to Josh's cubicle and tells him he shouldn't live in a fantasy staring at the billboard of Isabella. Josh then has Natalie sit in his chair to make it clear to her that he does not even have a full view of the billboard  and instead he was always looking at Natalie. She is touched  and the two kiss.Natalie walks out for coffee  and she is greeted downstairs with Whitney  who points out that now that she has made it to her dream job and has a guy who worships her  it's almost like she is in an actual romantic comedy. Natalie scoffs at the idea and says that all that needs to happen is a musical number.The film then cuts to the credits where the cast perform a musical number.  , 'None of the feels.'

As part of the facility is destroyed by the incident  mechanical engineer Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and her colleagues  Rodrigo (Mamoudou Athie) and Paul (T.J. Miller)  make their way to the escape pod bay.\nThe drilling facility is at a depth of 36 000 feet and pressure is at 8 tons per square inch. There have reports of strange sightings at the site before  but were dismissed by the Tian company. Anomalies include explosions  unexplained phenomena  and strange figures being seen.\nKepler station is the command and control center for the Reobuck drill station.However  the three discover that all of the escape pods have already been deployed  with Captain Lucien (Vincent Cassel) being the only person in the area when the three arrive. Together they reach a control base and find biologist Emily Haversham (Jessica Henwick) and engineer Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.)  who are unsuccessful in their attempts to make contact with the surface. The power core of the Kepler station has lost its cooling and is likely to explode.Lucien suggests using pressurized suits to walk one mile across the ocean floor to Roebuck 641 in the hope of resurfacing from there. To get to the surface of the ocean floor  the team has to take an elevator down.\nAs they descend in a freight elevator  Rodrigo's defective helmet implodes under the water pressure  killing him. The surviving crew see a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below  and Smith and Paul go to investigate. As they arrive at the location  they find a body in the rubble. A creature emerges from the corpse's back and attacks them. Smith kills the creature and takes it inside. Haversham examines the creature and realizes that it belongs to a previously undiscovered species. The group believe that the drilling hit a hydro thermal pocket somewhere that had a heat source to sustain life at this depth.The five make their way to the sea floor  but as they are walking  the Kepler explodes above and nearly buries them in debris. Smith is hit  but Price and Lucien save him. They manage to get through an access tunnel to an intermediate station  where they can charge and clean their suits. However  they find that Smith's oxygen scrubber is badly damaged from the debris. On their way through the access tunnel  Paul is attacked by an unknown creature  dragged underwater  and killed.\nAt the midpoint station  the crew sees a 6000 tons drill bit shred to pieces. They believe that humans were not supposed to drill so deep into the ocean and now the ocean is taking back.\nBefore the team leaves the access tunnel  they find that Smith's damaged oxygen pod will cause him to suffocate from the explosion's toxic fumes. Unwilling to leave another crew member behind  Price  Lucien  and Haversham agree to help Smith walk. The four set off across the ocean floor  but a humanoid creature appears and drags Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to get Smith out  but he is pulled from the other three. Price is dragged along with Lucien  but Lucien sacrifices himself to spare Price from the increasing pressure differential.Price ends up at the abandoned Shepard station alone and is able to change her damaged diving suit before continuing toward Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor  she reunites with Haversham and Smith  and proceeds to help drag Smith. As they enter Roebuck  they encounter a nest of the humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by  but the sound of Haversham's oxygen alarm wakes the creatures.\nPrice is partially swallowed by one of the creatures but is able to kill it and free herself. The three manage to reach the escape pod bay  but Price discovers that only two of the pods are functional. Price and Haversham manage to get the ailing Smith into a pod  and Price persuades Haversham to take the last one. As this happens  a gigantic creature emerges and attacks the Roebuck while the smaller creatures follow the two escape pods.\nPrice  accepting her impending death  initiates an overload of the Roebuck's nuclear core  resulting in a massive explosion that kills the creatures and allows the escape pods to reach the surface. This is followed by news headlines that say there were only two survivors  suggesting none of the other escape pods made it.Tian Industries refuses to be involved with investigations into the events and prepares to expand its drilling efforts.  , '7 Miles Below the Ocean Surface Something Has Awakened'

He brings her to an apartment he wants to buy for them  but they are technically breaking in. She likes the place  and he is preparing to create a stable future for the two of them.In the city  FBI Agent Meyers (Jeffrey Donovan) goes to work with his dog. He tells his superior  Agent Baker (Robert Patrick)  that he is going through a divorce  and that his wife is letting him keep the dog. Moments later  Tom calls the office to turn himself in and reveal himself as the In and Out Bandit  as well as complain that he hates that moniker. Since the FBI has gotten multiple Bandit confessions  they don\'t believe him and ask why he wants to turn himself in. He tells them he is in love with Annie and that he wants a fresh start. Unconvinced  Baker sends other agents Nivens (Jai Courtney) and Hall (Anthony Ramos) to interview Tom.When the two agents arrive at Tom\'s apartment  he tells them about a storage unit containing all the money he has stashed from past robberies. The agents go to the storage unit and are surprised to discover that Tom was telling the truth since he has millions of dollars stashed there. Nivens tries to get Hall in on a scheme where they pocket the money themselves  since Nivens knows Hall needs extra money to support his family. Hall reluctantly goes along with it. On their way out  the agents run into Annie  and they lie by saying they know Tom.The agents return to Tom\'s apartment. Nivens pulls out his gun in an attempt to execute Tom right there and steal the money  but the plan is interrupted when Baker shows up at the apartment. On impulse  Nivens shoots and kills Baker. Tom fights Nivens and Hall  leading him to fall out a window with Nivens  just as Annie is walking by. Though she is horrified  Tom tells her to run as they get away from the corrupt agents. Meanwhile  Nivens and Hall drive away trying to cover up the story  with Nivens wanting to frame Tom. Hall also knows Tom took his gun.Tom drives Annie to safety  but he is forced to come clean then and there about his past as a thief. He tells Annie the truth but says he truly wants to do right by her. She is highly dismayed at this news  even as Tom tries to be forthcoming about his intentions. Nivens and Hall pursue them on the road until Tom\'s car crashes. He and Annie hide out in a parking garage until they lose Nivens  and Tom hotwires another car to get away. At the same time  Meyers goes to the apartment to discover Baker\'s body and later has to inform Baker\'s wife of his death.Tom and Annie go to a playground for the time being. She is still angry at discovering his truth. He tells her about how his father lost his job after the CEO of his company embezzled from the employees  and his father committed suicide by driving a high speed into a tree. Tom later robbed from the same CEO. He admits that robbing gave him life  but everything changed when he met Annie. She slowly starts to forgive him  and he gets her home safe.In the morning  Meyers investigates Tom\'s past with Nivens and Hall after the former agent lies to Meyers about who killed Baker. They learn that his real last name is Dolan and that he was a Marine  which is where he learned about explosives and demolition. At the same time  Tom digs up information on Nivens.Annie calls Tom about getting footage from the storage warehouse that would implicate Nivens and Hall in stealing the money. When Annie does go get it  she is found by Nivens  who attacks her. Although Annie puts up a fight  Nivens knocks her out. He tries to shoot her dead  but Hall intervenes and takes the security footage from Annie. Tom finds Annie and takes her to a hospital. He then contacts Nivens and Hall  and Meyers listens in from his own phone. Tom calls out Nivens for attacking Annie  but he denies it  and Tom vows to go after him.A nearby officer recognizes Tom and chases after him. Nivens and Hall get wind of this and pursue as well. Tom loses the other cop and hides until he sees the agents  and he backs his van into their car. Nivens shoots at Tom  but he runs away and loses him. He runs into Meyers and briefly fights him until he assures him that he is on his side and that he didn\'t kill Baker. After he tells Meyers about Annie being hospitalized  the agent goes to sit in her room  where he later spots Nivens coming by to finish the job  but he leaves after seeing Meyers.Later that night  Hall is in bed with his wife Beth (Jasmine Cephas Jones) discussing some of his personal feelings. He then goes to the garage where he is ambushed by Tom. Hall tells him everything was entirely Nivens\'s doing  and he gives Tom the security footage. He also warns Tom that Nivens is going to try and kill Annie  so he goes to visit her and sees that she is awake. He is able to get her out and bring her to a safe room.Annie joins Tom as he goes after Nivens. He plants a bomb in his house and warns him with enough time to run out before he blows up the house. Tom knew Nivens would lead him to the space where he and Hall are keeping their stolen loot  while Annie waits for Meyers at the storage unit to find the rest of Tom\'s money. Tom finds Nivens and Hall there  leading to a shootout in which Hall is killed. Nivens tries to escape again and drives away in his car until Tom calls him and says that he put another bomb in his car  which is pressure sensitive and will detonate with the slightest movement. Nivens has no choice but to pull over and wait for the bomb squad to arrive. When they get there  they see that the bomb is a dud. With Meyers having a recording where Nivens and Hall explicitly discuss having killed Baker  AND with Nivens carrying stolen money  Meyers has the feds arrest him.Outside FBI HQ  Annie speaks to Meyers  asking him to go easy on Tom.

Using the nanites and RST servers to hack into databases  Ray tracks down Axe to Budapest and kills him along with his bodyguards. Back at RST  Ray is put to sleep as his nanites are rebooted. As he has done many times before  Harting then replaces Ray\'s memories with a new scenario of how Gina died  this time with Axe\'s associate Nick Baris (J??hannes Haukur J??hannesson) as the culprit. KT objects to Harting repeatedly manipulating Ray\'s memories so he will go after different targets without question or remorse  but she is ignored and reminded that RST can kill her by deactivating her enhancements.Ray awakens  once again amnesiac  and is reintroduced to RST  then experiences flashbacks of Baris kidnapping and killing him and Gina. Driven by revenge  he tracks Baris to East Sussex and kills him  despite the man pleading that RST is lying. Wilfred Wigans (Lamorne Morris)  a programmer forced to work for Baris  activates an EMP bomb that incapacitates Ray and severs his link with RST. Ray awakens in Wigans\'s office and experiences contradicting memories of who killed Gina. Wigans helps him realize RST has been manipulating him so he would kill the company\'s enemies and rivals. Ray tracks down Gina  learning she is still alive but that their relationship ended five years ago  and since then  she has started a family in London.Harting sends KT after Wigans. After asking Wigans for help in freeing herself from RST control and taking down the corporation  she tells Harting she failed to capture the programmer. Meanwhile  Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs and brought back to the laboratory. KT and Wigans sabotage the reprogramming process and destroy the RST computers. Ray awakens and Dalton and Tibbs try to subdue him. After a lengthy battle  he kills them as the RST building is destroyed. Harting confronts Ray  confident that the Marine will surrender now that his nanites have been exhausted. To his surprise  Ray is willing to die to achieve victory and activates an explosive  destroying them both. Ray later awakes with his full memories  revived by Wigans who has updated his technology so his nanites are self-sufficient. The two men and KT then leave in search of a new life.' , 'Being a hero is in his blood.'   You Don't Need a Past to Have a Future

A sudden storm pulls them into a portal to the New World where they find the remains of the missing soldiers and their vehicles. As the Diablos approaches them  the Hunter  who is observing the group  fires a warning signal. Impervious to bullets and grenades  the Diablos attacks and kills several members of the squad.The survivors hide in a cave  where they are attacked by a pack of Nerscyllas. Everyone is killed except for Artemis  who runs into the Hunter while trying to escape. They briefly fight before grudgingly agreeing to cooperate. Artemis learns that the portals are created by the Sky Tower  a structure located across the desert. To reach the Tower  the Hunter reveals they will need to kill the Diablos in order to cross the desert safely. Artemis learns how to fight using the Hunter's unique bladed weapons and helps him set a trap for the Diablos to kill it with Nerscylla venom. The attack is successful  with Artemis delivering the finishing blow  but the Hunter is badly wounded. Constructing a makeshift stretcher  Artemis dutifully carries him across the desert.The pair reaches an oasis populated with herbivorous creatures called Apceros. When a Rathalos  a fire-breathing wyvern  flies by and causes the Apceros to stampede  Artemis and the Hunter are rescued by a group of Hunters led by their chieftain: the Admiral. The Admiral explains that the Sky Tower was built by the first civilization to inhabit the New World  using the monsters to protect it. Artemis agrees to help kill the Rathalos so she can return home.In the ensuing battle  Artemis falls through the portal  returning to the real world. The portal doesn't close in time  and the Rathalos emerges and begins wreaking havoc. Artemis is able to slow it down long enough for the Hunter to slip through the portal and deliver the fatal shot. Though she has the chance to stay  Artemis decides to go back to the New World and remain with the Hunters to protect the real world from other monsters. The Admiral approaches her  just before the appearance of another flying monster known as Gore Magala. He notes that as long as the portal remains open  there will always be the threat that monsters will pass through to the real world. Artemis concludes that finding a way to take down the Sky Tower is now their primary objective.In a mid-credits scene  Palico  the Admiral's companion  arrives to help fight the Gore Magala  while an ominous cloaked figure observes the battle from the top of the tower.  , 'Join the hunt 2020'

Her father took her to see an enchantress  who removed the illness but left a power within the girl. As she grew older  people in the village went to the girl because she had premonitions of the future. Because she knew everything ended in death  she used her power to kill people  including her father. The child was taken into the woods to be left alone  but she lured other children to a grim fate.After their father\'s death  teenage Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother Hansel (Sam Leakey) are going to meet a man about a job as a housekeeper. Gretel meets with the man  but he makes his true intentions clear when he asks Gretel if she is still a virgin. The two leave without a job. At night  the siblings\' mother rebukes Gretel for not doing what she had to do to get a job and help provide for them. She tells Gretel that she and Hansel must leave because there is no room left in the house. The mother goes as far as threatening to hack Gretel to bits if they don\'t leave immediately. The siblings flee their home and find a hut to sleep in for the night.Suddenly  a ghoulish man arises and lets out a horrible scream and makes the kids run away. He chases them outside and attacks Hansel. Before he can get to Gretel  he is killed with an arrow to the head. The Huntsman (Charles Babalola) rescues the siblings and takes them into his home for the night and directs them toward others who can provide them with food and work. The following morning  the siblings go outside to forage and seek work. They get frustrated when they find nothing until Gretel spots some mushrooms. They turn out to be  magic  mushrooms that cause the two to laugh hysterically. Hansel then wanders until he finds a house that has a cake smell coming from it. Gretel follows as she hears what sounds like a girl\'s voice beckoning her  seen alongside The Beautiful Child being taken away in a carriage. Gretel tries to stop Hansel from going inside  but he goes anyway and appears to be taken by someone. Gretel tries to start a fire to break inside  but she is greeted by Holda (Alice Krige)  the woman living inside. She invites the siblings inside for a meal and allows them to sleep there in exchange for work.Holda has Hansel go out into the woods to practice his skills with an ax  while she keeps Gretel at the house. Hansel enjoys his time there because they have plenty of food  but Gretel becomes suspicious of Holda\'s intentions. Gretel starts to see a vision of the Enchantress and hears children\'s voices guiding her somewhere  but before she finds out what\'s going on  she wakes up in her bed.While Hansel goes out  Holda shows Gretel how to tap into her powers as a witch. Gretel goes into the woods and manages to use her power to bring a tree branch near her so she can take a fruit. Meanwhile  Hansel also sees a vision of the Enchantress and spots a satanic carving on a nearby tree. Hansel starts to grow suspicious of Holda. Later in the night  Gretel makes her way into Holda\'s cellar where Hansel is sitting in a trance. Suddenly  the floor fills with goo  and a younger witch emerges  emptying buckets of guts onto the table before turning them into food  the same that Holda fed the siblings. The next day  Gretel sits with Holda  who eats something and pulls a long strand of a child\'s hair out of her mouth. Gretel pleads with Holda to let Hansel go  but she refuses.Through a series of visions  she tells Gretel the truth about the story of the Beautiful Child: Holda was the girl\'s mother  and she resented her daughter after she killed her father  and she left the girl in the woods of her own accord. However  the child lingered in Holda\'s mind  promising to share her powers with her if she trusted the darkness. With that  Holda devoured her other children and took on the disguise of an old woman to appear friendly and lure other children to their fates. Holda straps Gretel to a table in the cellar as she assumes her youthful appearance to lure Hansel into a cage so she can cook him. Gretel manages to use her powers to send a staff toward Holda  impaling her to the wall over the flames. Her body catches fire  and she cries in agony until she is dead  breaking the trance on Hansel and letting Gretel go free. Gretel decides to stay behind at the house while sending Hansel on his way with a horse. The horse brings him back to his old house  where his mother no longer stays. Gretel then sees the spirits of the dead children emerge from the trees  now free at last. However  her fingers turn black just like Holda\'s did  but her voiceover states that she will be brave and trust in herself.' , 'A grim fairy tale.'  'Follow the crumbs.'

Preston  Esq (Alex Winter) and Ted  Theodore  Logan (Keanu Reeves). They went through time and Hell to create great music as the Wyld Stallyns  but after achieving big success at one point with multiple record albums  their music quality began to decline  and the world seemed to care less about them. Meanwhile  their actions have caused reality to bend  sending historical figures to different eras (Jesus switches places with Kid Cudi  for instance). To this day  they have not written the song that will unite the world.In the present day  Bill and Ted are at a wedding to perform for Ted\'s younger brother Deacon (Beck Bennett) and Missy (Amy Stoch)  who married both Bill and Ted\'s dads first. The guys play a mish-mash of instruments in their attempts to create their big song  but it just sounds bad  and Ted\'s elderly dad Jonathan (Hal Landon Jr.) thinks Bill and Ted are just washed up losers who waste their time and have been poor role models to their daughters  while also saying that their wives  Princess Joanna   Jo  (Jayma Mays) and Princess Elizabeth   Liz  (Erinn Hayes)  are the only real adults in their families  but Billie and Thea still believe in their dads.Liz and Jo bring their husbands to couples therapy  even though the intention was to do it separately. They talk to Dr. Wood (Jillian Bell)  where it is apparent that Bill and Ted can\'t do anything without each other  even tell their own wives  I love you . Liz and Jo admit that while they love their husbands  they do feel that the two are just going through are a routine that they can\'t grow out of.Bill and Ted go home feeling upset over how they are viewed  with Ted even thinking of selling his Les Paul guitar to make money. Suddenly  an egg-shaped time machine appears. Out steps Kelly (Kristen School)  the daughter of the guys\' previous time-travel guide Rufus who had apparently passed away some years earlier. Kelly tells Bill and Ted that they need to go with her. Billie and Thea watch as their dads hop in the time machine. The guys are taken 700 years into the future in San Dimas  California where Kelly brings them to meet her mom  The Great Leader (Holland Taylor). She explains to the guys that since they still haven\'t written the song that will unite the world  and worse still time and reality have begun bending in an event called  The Unraveling   and if the guys can\'t produce the song within less than 80 minutes (7:17 PM specifically)  reality is doomed. Kelly gives them a pocket watch from her father that will keep track of time in San Dimas. Bill and Ted know they won\'t have enough time  so they decide to try and go into their own futures to steal the song from themselves when they think they have already written it. They hop inside their old time traveling phone booth and head out.The guys end up in 2022 to find their future selves are performing at a lounge for people who aren\'t even listening to them. Present-Bill and Ted confront their future selves and learn that they have become bigger failures  not only in their music  but Liz and Jo left them after their own future selves showed them that there is no happy life with them  and their own daughters have stopped talking to them. The guys rush back to their present time-line to find their wives in therapy again  where they beg them not to join their future selves  but they still have a hard time saying  I love you  to them. Liz and Jo then see their future selves in their own time machine and head out. Dr. Wood also sees a historical figure appear on her couch  and she leaves.Back in the future  the Great Leader tells Kelly that perhaps the only way to bring balance back to reality is to have Bill and Ted killed. She sends a time-traveling cyborg called Dennis (Anthony Carrigan) to hunt the duo. Kelly then uses her time machine to go back to present day San Dimas to find Bill and Ted  but instead finds Billie and Thea  and the two decide they want to help their dads unite the world. They use the machine to go back to 1968 to meet Jimi Hendrix (DazMann Still) and try and recruit him for their song by uniting some of the greatest artists in history. Jimi is uninterested  so the girls realize they\'ll need bigger inspiration.Meanwhile  Bill and Ted go to 2025 where they come across a large mansion  thinking they have made it big as rock stars by now. They find their future selves dressed in flashy clothes and speaking with posh British accents that they say they got from time-traveling with their wives through the Medieval ages. They give their past selves what is supposedly the song that will unite the world for them to take back to their time  but as they are leaving  Present-Bill and Ted discover that the mansion belongs to Dave Grohl  and their old selves are actually balding  fat  alcoholics who are even worse than their 2022 selves. Jonathan and Deacon arrive with the SWAT team after Dave calls the cops  and since Future-Bill and Ted know what their past selves are going to do  Present-Bill and Ted come up with a crazy plan to cover their heads with buckets so their future selves won\'t know where they went. The guys make it to their time machine  just as Dennis arrives and prepares to vaporize them  but he is too late  as the guys leave  and he accidentally zaps Jonathan. He ends up in Hell where he is greeted by Death (William Sadler).Billie and Thea go to 1928 to find Louis Armstrong (Jeremiah Craft) where Billie shows him a video she recorded of Jimi onstage. Louis is impressed and goes to 1968 with the girls to meet Jimi. Although he still appears to not want to do it  especially since Louis Armstrong would be an old man at that time  Louis plays his trumpet  which is enough to convince Jimi to join them. They then take the two artists all the way back to Vienna in 1782 to find Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Daniel Dorr). They hear him performing one of his pieces  and Jimi takes out his guitar to mimic the notes. Mozart is impressed by what he hears and joins the team.Bill and Ted then go to 2030 where they find their future selves in prison  both of them jacked and tattooed. They took the fall for breaking into Dave\'s house  and now they plan to beat their past selves for it. However  Dennis shows up and attempts to kill Present-Bill and Ted  which Prison-Bill and Ted know will mean that they will die too. They get the inmates to pile on Dennis as Present-Bill and Ted make their escape.Billie and Thea bring the three musicians to China in 2600 B.C. to meet Ling Lun (Sharon Gee)  the founder of music in China. Mozart plays her bamboo flute  and she joins them. The girls take them even further into the past to North Africa where they meet a dimmer called Grom (Patty Anne Miller). They convince her to come along as well. With their band assembled  the girls return to present day San Dimas  where Kid Cudi also appears with time and reality still unraveling. He seems to understand the paradox that is occurring  just as Dennis shows up. He accidentally vaporizes everybody  as well as Kelly  and sends them all to Hell.Bill and Ted decide to go all the way to the end of their lives  which is somewhere in 2067. They find themselves super old in a retirement home. They present their younger selves with a flash drive containing their big song  called  Face The Music  and labeled  Preston/Logan MP46 7:17  (MP46 is where they need to go). As they prepare to head back  Dennis shows up to get Bill and Ted  but his programming won\'t allow him to kill them since they have the song. When they learn that he sent their daughters to Hell  Bill breaks the flash drive to get Dennis to kill them  but Dennis instead has a nervous breakdown and tries to kill himself. Bill and Ted jump into the path of the laser  which Liz and Jo see as their machine brings them to that time.The guys end up back in Hell and go searching for their daughters. They find them  as well as Jonathan  who realizes that everything Bill and Ted told them about time travel and death was true. After reuniting  they figure that they can get back to Earth with Death\'s help  but he had a falling out with Bill and Ted after they kicked him out of Wyld Stallyns for performing overlong solos. Billie and Thea talk to Death  as they are actually fans of his bass-playing  and they convince him to give their dads another chance. After Bill and Ted apologize  Death uses Jonathan\'s SWAT van to bring the family  and the historical musicians  back up to Earth.Everybody arrives in the present day 2020 on Interstate 210  which is where MP46 is. All of time and space starts coming undone  with monuments and other figures start jumping to other time periods and locations. Dennis gives Bill and Ted the pieces of the flash drive  but they still don\'t know how to write their big song. They then realize that the  Preston/Logan  is not them  but rather Thea and Billie  as they are the masterminds behind the big song  and their dads are their to back them up. The girls give instruments to their band members  which doesn\'t sound too great at first until they start to get things in sync. Liz and Jo show up and tell the guys that the happiest time-line with them is the one they are in now. Bill and Ted finally individually tell their wives they love them  and they all go through history to give everyone instruments to play  thereby actually uniting the whole world in song. When the guys return  they play epic guitar solos for the whole world to hear. Reality begins to set itself back to normal. Kelly and Dennis return to the future  where the Great Leader commends Kelly for her work  and everyone returns to their regular time-lines. Billie and Thea end with their narration on how their dads helped unite the world by getting everyone to play together.The end credits show people all over the world playing music together. After the credits  we see Old Bill and Ted checking up on each other before standing up to do another epic guitar solo.' , 'The Future Awaits'  'The Great Ones are back!'

He has the ability to communicate with animals  and he would travel the world with his beloved wife Lily (Kasia Smutniak)  finding other scared or hurt animals and bringing them to their sanctuary. One day  Lily went sailing on a voyage with Poly  but she was caught in a terrible storm where she perished. Poly brought Dolittle her ring back  and he became so distraught that he closed up the sanctuary  shutting himself away from contact with other people.Years later  a boy named Tommy Stubbins (Harry Collett) is hunting with his uncle and cousin. He is too nervous to hit a bird  and he accidentally shoots a squirrel named Kevin (voice of Craig Robinson). Stubbins' uncle gives him a knife to put the squirrel out of his misery  but Stubbins instead takes it with him. Poly spots the boy and tells him to follow her  where she leads him to Dolittle's sanctuary. Stubbins is startled by Yoshi the polar bear (voice of John Cena)  leading him to stumble into a trap. He is found by a girl called Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado)  who was sent by Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) on an urgent matter.Inside the sanctuary  Dolittle is playing chess with several mice against Chee-Chee  (voice of Rami Malek) a cowardly gorilla  joined by Dab-Dab  (Octavia Spencer)  a scatterbrained duck  and Jip  (voice of Tom Holland) a bespectacled dog. After learning that there are other humans outside  Dolittle sends Chee-Chee to answer the door. He and Stubbins freak each other out. Stubbins brings Kevin to Dolittle for help  while Lady Rose tells Dolittle that Queen Victoria has summoned him to Buckingham Palace. Dolittle helps Kevin recover but has no desire to leave his home. After much goading from Poly  Dolittle relents  tidies himself up  and heads out.Dolittle rides to Buckingham Palace using Plimpton (voice of Kumail Nanjiani)  a neurotic ostrich  while Poly  Yoshi  Kevin  Jip  and Dab-Dab join. Upon arriving  he finds his former medical school rival  Dr. Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen)  there to check on the queen  brought up by Lord Badgley (Jim Broadbent). Dolittle and his animals enter the Queen's room  where he talks to her pet squid and learns that she was poisoned with deadly nightshade. The only cure is the Eden Fruit  which is on a far away island. Dolittle takes it upon himself to seek the tree out and bring back the fruit to save the Queen before an eclipse occurs  at which point she will perish. Although Stubbins wants to join Dolittle and be his apprentice after being amazed by the animals  Dolittle simply sends him back home.The next morning  Betsy the giraffe (voice of Selena Gomez) and Tutu the fox (voice of Marion Cotillard) join Poly in helping Stubbins escape his home and join Dolittle on his voyage. However  once they get to the docks  the ship has already departed. They spot a bridge  so Betsy rides with Stubbins until they manage to make it there and have him jump safely onto the ship.While on their journey  Stubbins takes time to learn the language of the other animals  which impresses Dolittle. Soon  Mudfly and his cronies sail nearby in their own ship and begin to catch up. Dolittle and Yoshi go underwater to get a whale to help pull them faster to the island. Dolittle's rope starts to break  so Stubbins tries to pull it back with Yoshi's help  but Chee-Chee freezes up when he has a chance to help pull. Dolittle does manage to get himself back onto the ship  but Chee-Chee is ashamed at himself for failing to help.Since their map doesn't have the exact location of the Eden Tree  the crew must stop at an island of bandits  run by King Rassouli (Antonio Banderas)  who was also Lily's father. He is in possession of Lily's journal  which has the tree's location. Knowing that Rassouli would NOT be happy to see him  he and Stubbins attempt to disguise themselves. They are led by a dragonfly named James (voice of Jason Mantzoukas) to Rassouli's room where Stubbins tries to sneak in and find the journal while trying not to wake up Rassouli or his pet lionesses. The boy gets close  but Rassouli spots him and captures him  along with Dolittle.Rassouli throws Dolittle into a den where he must deal with a gold-fanged tiger named Barry (voice of Ralph Fiennes)  who has serious mommy issues and has a bone to pick with Dolittle for not helping him get over this  while Stubbins is taken by the other bandits. Although Dolittle tries again  Barry is set on eating him. The other animals show up to help after Stubbins has James send them a message  with Yoshi blowing up the bandits' hideout  while Chee-Chee breaks into the cage and musters up the nerve to fight Barry. They help Dolittle get out as Stubbins has gotten the journal  but they are stopped by Mudfly and his soldiers  where the villain admits to having the Queen poisoned so that he can go find the cure and bask in all the rewards. They take the journal and destroy Dolittle's ship.As things are looking down  Yoshi and Plimpton bond over having negligent fathers. Dolittle expresses his disappointment in himself  which Rassouli overhears. Although he dislikes Dolittle for taking Lily away  he knows she would have wanted him to continue his quest. He gives him an old ship to allow him to return to the sea. Dolittle uses the help of whales to track down Mudfly's ship.The crew reaches the island but spot Mudfly's men already making their way inside. They climb up another way to get past the villains and eventually come across the tree and the fruit  but Mudfly and his men get there as well. Soon  they are confronted by a large dragon (Frances De La Tour)  who begins to attack the soldiers. Dolittle saves Mudfly from getting killed  which leads to him having an epiphany about being a better person  only to push another soldier in the dragon's path before falling down a hole. After scaring away the other soldiers  the dragon sets her sights on Dolittle and his friends  but he then spots another dragon skeleton  which makes him realize she has lost her beloved  and so he sympathizes with her. He also notes that she is backed up internally  so he proceeds to give her an enema so that she may expel all the armor and weaponry that she has devoured over the years. She thanks Dolittle and allows him to take the fruit.With the Queen mere minutes from death  Dolittle and the animals manage to make it in time. However  Lord Badgley attempts to send the guards after them. The animals hold them off and get the fruit to Stubbins  who uses it to heal the Queen. Dolittle then learns from a stick bug that he left behind that Badgley is the mastermind behind the Queen's poisoning  as he has the vial of nightshade in his pocket. Badgley attempts to escape but is quickly subdued and imprisoned. The Queen thanks Dolittle and Stubbins for saving her.Dolittle returns to his sanctuary where he has officially taken Stubbins on as an apprentice  and he has decided to reopen the sanctuary to the public  as Lily would have wanted.During the closing credits  we see Mudfly still in the cave.

She runs to her car and attempts to drive off of the plantation. From a bedroom window of the house  a little girl named Flora watches. The woman reaches the gates that lead off of the property but is stopped by a man in the darkness who grabs her by the throat.Some time after  new governess Kate accepts the proposition of watching two children on the rich plantation  Flora and Miles. She is drawn to the proposition having been an orphan herself since her father left her mother who went insane and has been living at an insane asylum ever since. Her mother spends her time alone painting indiscernible paintings. Kate says goodbye to her mother and then leaves for the estate. Once there  she is met by the cold and unfeeling housekeeper Mrs. Gross. She quickly befriends little Flora and then is told from Gross that Flora has never left the estate. Flora tells Kate that she has never been in the darker area of the house  the East Wing. That night  Kate is drawn to the East Wing and then finds herself trapped within. She escapes and comes face-to-face with the relentlessly creepy and infuriating-to-watch-to-the-point-of-near-insanity  Miles who has returned from Boarding School.The next morning  Kate learns from the Headmaster at Miles' school that Miles has been expelled for beating a classmate up and nearly killing him. Gross refuses to believe this and remains a nagging and annoying person to Kate for the remainder of the film- contributing nothing to Kate's plight. Miles cuts Kate off whenever she tries to reach out to him  and Kate learns from Flora that the former nanny Miss Jessel left without saying Goodbye which hurt Flora. Kate finds Jessel's notebook and reads it  finding out that Miles' horse-trainer Quint had been making constant moves on Jessel and assaulting her. Kate is then haunted by terrible nightmares of Miles attacking her  Miles turning into Quint  and Quint's hands trying to molest her.Kate learns from Gross that Quint died when he fell from his horse in a drunken ride. Having been fed up with Miles' annoying and relentlessly infuriating behavior  (the kind that would make any sane audience member want to punch his teeth down his throat) Kate contemplates leaving the job but remembers her promise to Flora and remains. Kate then receives some mail from her mother as well as a set of black paintings  which she looks at. That night  she is lured outside by Jessel's ghost to a set of ruins in the woods. It is there where she finds Jessel's corpse in a pool of water. Kate returns to the mansion and is lured by voices to a room in the East Wing where she sees the ghostly vision of Jessel being strangled to death by Quint.Kate is attacked by Quint but Gross opens the door and shakes her out of this stupor. Realizing Gross knows what became of Jessel  Kate attempts to take the kids away. Gross infers that she orchestrated Quint's death having been fed with his behavior and bad influence on Miles. They are then attacked by Quint's ghost who kills Gross by pushing her over the stairs. Kate finds Flora and Miles- the latter of which apologizes for his unworthiness. They pile up in Kate's car and leave the premises  driving away into the night.But wait- that never happened! All of what Kate experienced was a hallucination within the black paintings her mother made her. Kate confronts the children about their treatment of her and they deny they had anything to do with her. Kate accidentally breaks one of Flora's dolls and Flora freaks out. Miles points out that Kate is broken just like the doll. Kate then sees herself on a red bed at the dark asylum. A demonic figure who looks like her mother is there  crawling on the floors of the asylum and painting on the floor. The creature looks at Kate  who screams and recoils in horror at what she sees.\nSorry if you came here for more explanations of what that meant- your guess is as good as mine.  , 'Watch the Children With Care.'

The knife is placed in Cecilia's hand  who is then arrested and moved to a sanitarium. Now doubting her own sanity and finding out she is pregnant with Adrian's child  Cecilia gives in but is then confronted by Tom who explains he was working with his brother the whole time. Tom says that she will lose the fortune and be admitted permanently to this institution unless she returns to Adrian with his child. Cecilia refuses  still enraged that he killed her sister. Tom leaves but not before Cecilia steals one of his pens.In her room  Cecilia prepares to kill herself by slashing her wrist with the pen but the invisible man stops her. Having pulled him out of hiding by using herself as bait  Cecilia stabs him with the pen twice  causing his suit to glitch and for him to appear and disappear at random.

James tries to intervene but is beaten horribly in front of a terrified Sydney. Cecilia breaks in and sprays the figure with a fire extinguisher  revealing his shape before unloading on him with a fallen officer's pistol. The Invisible Man falls to the floor and dies of his wounds. Cecilia unmasks The Invisible Man  revealing him to be Tom. Adrian is found tied and walled up in his house when a SWAT team storms his place. James explains that the evidence suggests that Tom used his brother to get at Cecilia but she is still convinced that Adrian and Tom were working together and that in case the worst happened  Adrian set it up that Tom would take the fall.Still stressed from the series of events  Cecilia calls Adrian and agrees to meet him for dinner. Cecilia is wearing a listening device hoping to find a way to get a confession out of him with the help of James  who is positioned outside the property. Cecilia asks him if he was stalking her but Adrian denies it at first but later implies that he was indeed preying upon her. As Cecilia excuses herself to the bathroom  Adrian begins to realize something else is up when suddenly his head is jerked back and his throat is slashed. Adrian collapses to the ground  bleeding to death. Cecilia enters the room and appears shocked before calling the police  reporting an apparent suicide in a panicky tone. Cecilia then gloats over Adrian's dying body and implies that she did this using his invisible suit. James rushes in and finds Cecilia escaping with Adrian's suit and dog. Upon discovering that she set this up with the plan of murdering him  James lets her go nonetheless. Cecilia leaves into the night  perhaps with the plan of stealing her husband's work for her own future benefit.  ,  What You Can't See Can Hurt You

As they drown in tar  they tell him to find somewhere called 'tomorrow'. He goes on a long journey to find it and in the process  meets a young Belt before taking him along for the ride.Some time after the events of the first movie  the Croods (along with Guy and their pets Chunky and Douglas) are still searching for a place to settle down at all while surviving many dangerous creatures along the way. Grug is repeatedly annoyed at Eep and Guy's blossoming romance and it gets worse when he overhears them thinking about settling down together somewhere else away from the Croods. As Grug walks off in anger  he soon comes across a giant wall and leads the whole pack to them. When they bust inside  they see that the wall covers a huge land full of fruits and streams and they believe they have finally found a place to call their home. They are soon caught in a net and are released by the owners of the land  a couple called the Bettermans  Phil and Hope. When the Bettermans meet Guy  they reveal that they know each other from Guy's late parents.The Bettermans welcome the Croods to their giant tree-home as house guests  where they meet their daughter and Guy's old friend  Dawn  who immediately befriends Eep. Life with the Bettermans becomes degrading for Grug due to their evolved lifestyle rubbing off on his family like Thunk getting hooked on watching stuff from their window (similar to a television) and them sleeping in separate beds rather than together and the Bettermans soon reveal themselves to be biased against the cave family because of how destructive they are  believing that Guy is better off with them and hatch a scheme to get Guy to leave the Croods. Phil eventually takes Grug to his secret man-cave (a sauna-like place behind some waterfalls) where he manipulates him into believing Guy should leave their pack. Also  Hope gets on Ugga's bad-side by passive-aggressively saying they should leave while Guy remains with them.Eep and Dawn soon take use Chunky to escape the land and jump their wall for a joyride that ends with a bee stinging Dawn and having her hand swell up. When Eep takes her back home  Guy  upon finding out  chides her for her recklessness  ending with him insensitively calling her a 'cave-girl'. At dinner  tensions rise between the parents  Guy and Eep  especially when Dawn's swelling is revealed. Having enough  the Croods decide to leave in the morning  but Guy decides to stay after he and Eep have a falling out. Soon  the land is attacked by 'Punch-Monkeys' (monkeys with human-like strength) on account of Grug and Ugga eating a bunch of bananas the Bettermans hoard around their land and have forbidden Grug from eating. Phil reveals he sends the Punch-Monkeys the bananas every day so that they leave the Bettermans alone and since Grug and Ugga ate them  the Punch-Monkeys get upset and kidnap Grug  Phil  and Guy and take them to their homeland.As the men are taken  Thunk  Ugga  Eep  Gran  Sandy  Belt  Sash (Dawn's pet sloth)  Hope  and Dawn go to rescue them  but eventually get marooned on an island full of Dog-Spiders. During their time together  Hope soon grows to accept the Croods and eventually form a team called the Thundersisters (which was an old girl-group Gran was in when she was younger) to mount a rescue and in the process  Gran revealed that her hair was just a furry bat. At the Punch-Monkey home  Grug  Guy and Phil soon discover that Phil unintentionally deprived the Punch-Monkeys of their water resource and that the Punch-Monkeys need the bananas not only to eat  but to offer to a giant Punch-Monkey in hopes of appeasing it. Since the bananas are gone  they need a substitute. The monkeys make Grug and Phil fight gladiator-style to see who will be the sacrifice and when they wear each other out  they exchange their bitter feelings with each other  making Guy regret what he said during his and Eep's fallout.Soon  the monkeys dress all 3 men as bananas to sacrifice to the giant Punch-Monkey. Grug and Phil apologize for their poor behavior and for putting pressure on Guy  but just as they are about to be eaten  the Thundersisters show and to rescue them. A long and perilous battle soon ends with Guy and Eep on a giant skull-chandelier where they reconcile and soon use it to defeat the giant Punch-Monkey by using fire to cut the ropes and send it falling into the abyss below when it catches Eep's 'peanut toe' (which she uses as a prosthetic limb) and pulls it off  allowing the families to escape.With their differences finally settled  the Bettermans allow the Croods to live in their land as neighbors  with Guy realizing that Eep is his 'tomorrow' and he and Eep soon move into one of the Betterman's bedrooms together and Grug finally accepts his daughter leaving with Guy.  ,  The future ain't what it used to be    All in a Day's Survival    All in a day's survival.

Union Army troops discovered Joanna while dispersing a Kiowa camp and she was being taken to her living aunt and uncle by the freedman. A passing Union Army patrol instructs Kidd to take the girl to Union officials at an outpost in a town up the road. Kidd has little choice but to acquiesce.At the town  Kidd is informed that the outpost\'s Bureau of Indian Affairs representative will be unavailable for three months.

Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born  and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend  centaur police officer Colt Bronco  whom Ian and Barley dislike.On Ian\'s sixteenth birthday  Laurel gives her sons a gift from Wilden: a magical staff  a rare Phoenix gem  and a letter describing a  visitation spell  that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell  but only the lower half of Wilden\'s body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell  taking Barley\'s beloved van  Guinevere . Finding the boys gone  Laurel leaves to look for them.Ian and Barley visit the Manticore\'s Tavern  named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a family restaurant managed by the Manticore ( Corey  for short). While arguing with Ian over the map  Corey realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of insanity  accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers\' only clue to the gem is a children\'s menu suggesting  Raven\'s Point   a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends Corey  who agrees to help her. Corey warns Laurel that the brothers\' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her sword  which she and Laurel steal from a pawn shop.Traveling to the mountains  Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a motorcycle gang of pixies  7  relying on Ian\'s newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley\'s RPG instincts.  Raven\'s Point  leads them on a trail indicated by a series of raven statues  but Colt follows them  calling in reinforcements. After coming to a dead end  Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide  blocking their pursuers. Following the statues  the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures  during which Barley reveals to Ian that he was unable to emotionally bring himself to say goodbye to Wilden when he was dying in the hospital. The final obstacle sends them back to the surface  where they find themselves in front of Ian\'s high school. Infuriated at Barley\'s advice  Ian lashes out at him for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.Rereading his list of things he always wished to do with Wilden  Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life  and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the needed gem inside a historic fountain across the street from high school and retrieves it  unwittingly triggering the curse Corey spoke of  which creates a dragon-shaped golem out of pieces of the school and other nearby objects  bent on claiming the gem. Ian\'s staff is knocked into the ocean during a battle with the golem  but he reforms it from a splinter embedded in his hand and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel  who plunges the magic sword into the golem\'s heart  buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden\'s body. Ian sends Barley ahead to finally give his proper goodbye to Wilden  and holds off the golem long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates  Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him  and the brothers share a hug.Some time later  Ian\'s confidence and spell-casting have improved and he surprises Barley by painting his new van  christened  Guinevere The Second . Corey reopens her tavern in its original spirit  drawing in customers with tales of past adventures. She and Laurel become friends  and Ian and Barley develop a better relationship with Colt  who was inspired to start galloping with his own feet. As the world begins to rediscover the magical arts of the past  the brothers set off on a new quest.' , 'Cometh Soon.'

His mission also seems to be to rescue a man  which he does so with the help of a team with whom he blends in with SWAT teams. During the operation  the plutonium is found to be fake. Furthermore  The Protagonist realizes that the opera was being bombed and so he collects the bombs to save the people. The Protagonist is at gunpoint by one SWAT member but is saved by a masked gunman with a red string on his back. The masked man appeared to be using a time-reversed gun. The Protagonist throws the bag of bombs away and the people are saved. He is then abducted and tortured until he bites on an apparent suicide pill before revealing any information.Upon waking  the Protagonist learns the pill was a test of his loyalty. He also is told that his team didn\'t get clear. He is recruited into a secret organization  given only the information that the word  Tenet  and a cross-fingered gesture will  open many doors  for him. The Protagonist infiltrates a facility where he learns that in the future  technology has been developed that allows objects to have their entropy reversed and move backward through time. To demonstrate this  a scientist presents him with bullets that fire in reverse. The scientist believes that there is a war coming as objects are being streamed back in time from the future.Tracking the metal from which the reversed bullets are made  the Protagonist infiltrates the compound of an Indian billionaire in Mumbai with the aid of Neil (Robert Pattinson)  a British intelligence agent. He learns that it is in fact the billionaire\'s wife  Priya (Dimple Kapadia)  who knows what is happening. Priya tells the Protagonist that the time-reversing technology is under the control of a Russian arms dealer  Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh)  who is in communication with the future.The Protagonist meets Sir Michael Crosby (Michael Caine) who tells him that an explosion went off in a now-abandoned city in Russia known as Stalsk-12. The Protagonist learns from him that in order to get to Sator  he needs to approach his  practically estranged  wife Kat (Elizabeth Debecki). The Protagonist meets Kat and they talk at a restaurant. Kat tells the Protagonist that Sator has her under his control due to a forged painting that she gave to him. She also mentions that she tried to love him again to see if he would let her go free but Sator gave her the option to stay or leave and never see her son again. She says she saw a woman dive off their yacht in Vietnam when they were on holiday. Sator\'s men arrive at the restaurant soon. The Protagonist manages to fight his way and escape but one of them drives away with Kat just as the Protagonist finishes the last henchman.The Protagonist later tries to win Kat\'s trust by retrieving the painting from a freeport at Oslo Airport. Neil goes first to inspect the situation and they plan to crash a cargo plane to start a fire to activate the lockdown procedure  allowing them to steal the painting. They take the help of Mahir (Himesh Patel)  who crashes the aircraft and drops gold bars on the road as a distraction. During the operation  however  the Protagonist and Neil are attacked by two masked men  one inverted and one forward who emerged from a temporal stile in the pentagon. Both antagonists escape before the Protagonist and Neil are able to find out who they are. The Protagonist meets Priya who tells him that the two antagonists were the same person.The Protagonist returns to Kat  asking for her help in meeting Sator. Kat arranges for the Protagonist to attend a dinner party  hosted by Sator  but the oligarch does not trust the Protagonist until he mentions  opera . The Protagonist  Kat  and Sator go sailing where Sator and the Protagonist are discussing about plutonium when Kat pushes Sator out of the boat. The Protagonist saves him and Kat is mad at him for that. Sator says he is in debt so he funds the Protagonist who offers to steal weapons-grade plutonium for him.The Protagonist and Neil plan a heist on a highway and they succeed in stealing the plutonium  which is in an orange case  from an armored vehicle but they are interrupted by an inverted car. The car chases them until they see an inverted Sator holding a forward Kat at gunpoint in it. A crashed Saab on the road flips back and drives backward in between them. Sator signals the Protagonist to hand over the plutonium but the Protagonist hands over an empty orange case and throws the plutonium into the Saab. The Protagonist uncovers Sator and his gang\'s plot: they are operating a  temporal pincer movement  in which they move both forwards and backward in time  by means of entering a  temporal stile  following the operation and then moving backward through time.At the  temporal junction   Sator shoots Kat and leaves with her before Neil calls for reinforcements and they arrive to secure the temporal stile. The Protagonist suspects them  questioning Neil about who these people are. Neil tells him they are Priya\'s men  a team led by Ives (Aaron Taylor Johnson). The Protagonist follows Sator back through the temporal stile despite being warned not to  where he turns out to be the driver of the Saab. He puts a radio device on an empty orange casing on the road and waits for it to go back into a car. He follows it and it turns out Sator saw the plutonium flying from the Saab back into forward Protagonist\'s hands. He hears from the device that Sator had assembled the algorithm (the fake plutonium pieces) which are being taken to the hypocentre. In the chase  the Saab crashes with the inverted Protagonist inside it. Sator burns the car which turns into ice and manages to get hold of the algorithm piece off-screen. The Protagonist is rescued by Ives\' team.Sator is revealed to be dying from inoperable pancreatic cancer and has turned omnicidal  believing that if he is to die  he would prefer to spread death to all humanity. Sator is not looking for plutonium  but some future algorithm (9 pieces of the fake plutonium) that can cause the entropy  time direction  of the world to reverse. The algorithm will be created in the future by a future scientist as a way to turn back time since their future Earth is ruined by decisions made by present-day humans. Sator plans to use the algorithm as a doomsday device that will reverse entropy for the entire Earth  killing everything on it. He plans to return to a point in time when he was happy with Kat and then set off the device  which is connected to a dead man\'s switch linked to his heartbeat.The Protagonist  Neil  and Kat follow Sator backward in time  travelling in a cargo ship container back to Oslo. The trio infiltrates the freeport art storage facility once again where they enter the temporal stile that allows Kat to move forwards through time again and have her gunshot wound healed. The Protagonist soon discovers he was  in fact  the unknown antagonist during their first operation at the freeport and hence has to fight his past self to go through.The Protagonist meets Priya to ask her to warn his past self about how dangerous Sator is. However  she says she won\'t change what is about to happen. The Protagonist wants her word that Kat will be safe. This is because she has seen too much of what they are trying to keep secret - a loose end. Priya gives him her word. She also reveals to him that Tenet will be founded in the future. She says Ives has a team ready for the mission.They travel further back in time  where a military operation is launched whereby the Protagonist and Neil attempt to retrieve the doomsday device from Sator\'s men from the future in Stalsk-12  while Kat is with her husband on his yacht  aiming to prevent him from killing himself before the doomsday device is retrieved. They operate in a temporal pincer movement where the red team moves forward covering the blue team\'s extraction and the blue team moves backward covering the red team\'s extraction. The Protagonist and Ives are on the red team while Neil is on the blue team.Neil uses a temporal stile there to invert back to forward  halfway through the operation  to warn the Protagonist and Ives about a trap that he witnessed planted by Volkov - one of Sator\'s men. However  Neil\'s efforts are in vain. The Protagonist and Ives enter the tunnel and get stuck in there. They go deeper and find the place where the doomsday device is monitored by Volkov who is behind a gate that is locked. They also see a member of the blue team dead beside Volkov with a red string attached to his bag. The Protagonist recognizes this unknown person from the opera siege. Sator talks to the Protagonist from the boat about his plan through a communication device in the tunnel. Sator explains that since that future is dying so they have no other option than to turn back to the past. Sator then orders Volkov to shoot the Protagonist in the head when the dead body emerges  takes the shot and the gate unlocks. The Protagonist and Ives kill Volkov and retrieve the doomsday device. The blue team member closes the gate and goes back to the entrance.Time is running out. Neil who has switched halfway throws a rope through the hole on top of the tunnel and the Protagonist and Ives hold on as they are pulled up. Kat kills Sator on the boat. The explosion goes off but the world is saved. Kat realizes that she was the woman her past self had seen on the boat and dives into the water.Ives breaks the algorithm into 3 pieces and divides it between himself  the Protagonist  and Neil. Ives emphasizes that they should keep it secret. Neil passes his piece to the Protagonist as he intends to go back in. It was then that the Protagonist notices that Neil has a red string on his back. He deduces that Neil was therefore the masked man who saved him during the opera siege and the blue team member who gets killed by Volkov inside the tunnel. The Protagonist sheds tears as he knows his friend\'s destiny now. Neil reveals that he was hired into this operation in past by the future Protagonist and thus has known him for years. Neil tells the Protagonist that he\'ll see him at the beginning and goes back into the operation with the blue team.The Protagonist then saves Kat from being killed by Priya after all of the film\'s events  revealing that it is his job to tie up loose ends and that he has been the leader of Tenet operations for two years in the past.' , 'Time Runs Out'

As a child  her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker  but she got educated and earned a PhD  becoming a psychologist. That\'s where she met The Joker and fell in love  leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However  they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison (shown at the end of the previous film \'Suicide Squad\')  and despite Harley saying she was fine  she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce (after Bruce Wayne).Harley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered (drunk) and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg  and is told by the club\'s owner  Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor)  that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn\'t told anybody that she and Joker are broken up  since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham\'s other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she\'s nothing without Joker and that she\'ll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay  obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.Moments before this  Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena Bertinelli/Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) killing the men inside with a crossbow  which has earned her the alias   The Crossbow Killer.  Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley\'s J necklace  which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more  meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.Among the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friend/right hand man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina)  a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.Harley is getting her  perfect egg sandwich   but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street  which devastated Harley. When it seems like she\'s cornered  she throws a bag of garbage at Montoya  which blindsides one crook and causes him to shoot an incoming truck-driving crook  allowing Harley to get away. Unfortunately  she runs into a large thug that she and Joker face-tattooed  but before he can get her  he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman\'s thugs.Montoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers. She meets with Captain Patrick Erickson (Steven Williams)  who was her former partner that took credit for her hard work and got promoted  and District Attorney Ellen Yee (Ali Wong)  who is also Montoya\'s ex. She is building a case against Roman but doesn\'t have much support from either of them. Montoya is then brought to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco)  a young girl brought in for pick pocketing. Montoya then gets a call from Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell)  saying that Cass has a diamond with her. Soon  Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass  but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.A week earlier at the club  Roman was telling Mr. Keo (Francois Chau) about the Bertinelli Diamond  which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman\'s possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena\'s whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman  which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family. Dinah works at the club as a singer  noted for her beautiful voice. She later talks to a drunken Harley  who admits to her that she and Joker broke up. Harley then drinks with another man who later tries to abduct her. Dinah sees this and beats up the man and his buddies. Roman observes this from his window and is impressed  and he has Zsasz bring Dinah up so he can hire her as his new driver. This leads Montoya to try and get info from Dinah on Roman  but she refuses to help.Dinah knows Cass because they live in the same building  and Dinah has a soft spot for Cass since she knows she lives with abusive foster parents. Later on  Cass picks Zsasz\'s pocket and steals the diamond  just before she is arrested for other stuff she stole.Just after Harley gets away from Montoya  Roman\'s guys capture her. She knows he had a long list of grievances against her (such as  voting for Bernie  pronouncing it \'expresso\'  and calling him Romey ). Roman smacks Harley around  at which point she has a fantasy about herself as Marilyn Monroe in a  Diamonds Are A Girl\'s Best Friend  sequence. Before Roman can have Harley killed  he learns from Zsasz that the diamond is gone. Harley offers a chance to recover the diamond  which Roman agrees to. After she leaves  he orders a bounty on Cass.Cut to Harley attacking the police station with colored smoke and confetti bombs. She breaks Cass out but also lets loose other crooks who want to kill her. Harley fights them all on her own  with a little help from Cass  utilizing a baseball bat and lighter  among other things. More goons who want Cass and the diamond shows up  and after inhaling some coke  Harley kills them. She escapes the station with Cass in tow and takes her somewhere safe.Roman learns that Harley and Cass got away from his goons. He loses his shit and spots a woman  Erika (Bojana Novakovic)  in his club laughing  and Zsasz convinces Roman that she is laughing at him. He orders Erika to dance on the table and to take off her dress  going as far as to order her friend to cut it off of her. This shows Dinah just how monstrous Roman is.Harley learns that Cass swallowed the diamond and goes to a supermarket to buy laxatives  warning her that anyone else will have no problem cutting it out of her. They rob their supplies and go back to Harley\'s apartment  which is above a Taiwanese restaurant run by Doc (Dana Lee)  a kindly man who keeps Harley safe. After Harley and Cass go upstairs  Helena approaches Doc to ask for Harley. Harley then cuts to Helena\'s backstory: after her family was murdered by mob boss Stefano Galante (Roberto Catrini)  one of Galante\'s goons saw that she survived but took her away to Sicily to stay with his brother and father. They trained Helena to become the killer that she is now. She killed Galante  and the mob guys from earlier were the firing squad that killed her family. Zsasz is the last name on her list.Back at the police station  Montoya finds out that Yee went behind her back and told Erickson that she stole evidence from a crime scene. Erickson suspends Montoya.Harley\'s apartment comes under attack by one of Roman\'s goons. The place gets blown up  and Bruce goes missing. Harley learns that Doc sold her out to Roman\'s goons because they paid him well. Harley then contacts Roman and offers to trade Cass in exchange for immunity. He agreed and has Dinah drive Zsasz to meet them  but Zsasz spots a text exchange between Dinah and Montoya to let her know where they are headed. He informs Roman  who becomes upset and puts on his Black Mask.Harley arranges to be met at an amusement park in a spot called the Booby Trap where she used to hide with Joker. Cass learns about the betrayal as Harley straps her to a toilet so she can pass the diamond. Montoya shows up first and fights Harley  nearly taking her in until Harley uncuffs herself and kicks Montoya out of the building. Dinah and Zsasz show up  but Zsasz hits Harley with a tranquilizer and prepares to kill her. Helena shows up and shoots Zsasz in the neck with an arrow  killing him. The ladies then confront each other until they see Roman show up outside with a whole army of thugs. Knowing that he has a bone to pick with all of them  Harley suggests they team up to fight them all. They reluctantly agree and grab a bunch of old weapons (mallet for Harley  bat for Dinah  brass knuckles for Montoya  etc) and head off to fight. They smash and bash their way through a bunch of goons before Roman manages to kidnap Cass. The ladies are cornered by armed goons until Dinah lets out a supersonic scream to take them down and allow Harley to go after Roman on roller blades.Harley chases Roman and gets knocked over by other goons. Helena rides by and gives Harley a pull  managing to kill those other goons before causing Roman\'s car to crash. He takes Cass to the pier and tries to taunt Harley  saying she needs him. She hits back that the criminals in Gotham should fear her  not him or Joker. Before Roman can hurt Cass  she reveals she planted a grenade on him and pulled the pin out. Harley throws Roman off the pier where he explodes into bloody chunks before hitting the water. The others join Harley and Cass  relieved that Roman is now gone.The next morning  the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas. Cass goes to pass the diamond  but she and Harley just steal Dinah\'s car and ride off.Later on  Erickson once again takes credit for Montoya\'s work in bringing down Roman and his empire. She quits the GCPD and joins Dinah and Helena to form the Birds of Prey using the money in the Bertinelli accounts.Harley and Cass pawn the diamond and ride away with Bruce (who turned up alive)  with Harley taking Cass on as her apprentice. Harley says she may be a softie  but she dares anyone else to call her that.After the credits:Harley\'s voice can be heard getting ready to tell the audience a big secret about Batman... only for the audio to cut off.' , 'Mind Over Mayhem'  'Prey for Gotham!'

Emily is mortally wounded during a Boer sniper attack on the camp. Before she dies  Emily makes Orlando promise never to let their son see war again.Twelve years later  Orlando has formed a private spy network consisting of domestic servants employed by the world\'s most powerful dignitaries and has recruited his own servants Shola (Djimon Hounsou) (Merlin) and Polly (Gemma Arterton) (Gallahad) into it. The network\'s primary objective is to protect the United Kingdom and the British Empire from the approaching Great War. Conrad is eager to fight  but Orlando forbids him to join the British Army and persuades Lord Kitchener (Charles Dance)  Secretary of State for War  not to let him do so.At the behest of Kitchener  Conrad and Orlando ride with Orlando\'s friend Archduke Franz Ferdinand (Ron Cook) through Sarajevo. Conrad saves the Archduke from a bomb thrown by Gavrilo Princip (Joel Basman)  a rebel intent on sparking a war. Princip later encounters the Archduke\'s entourage again by chance and succeeds in fatally shooting him and his wife Sophie.King George of England  Tsar Nicholas of Russia and Kaiser Wilhem of Germany were cousins  kept in check by Queen Victoria. The death of Archduke Ferdinand will allow Kaiser Wilhem to move his armies against Austria and disturb a fragile peace. On Shepherd\'s orders  Erik  an advisor to Kaiser  goads him to ignore King George and attack Austria.\nThis quickly escalates into WW I and weakens Europe.Orlando visits the prison in Sarajevo and learns that Princip is part of  The Flock : a group plotting to pit the German  Russian  and British empires against each other. The Flock has its headquarters on an isolated clifftop and is led by  The Shepherd  Captain Maximilian  Max  Morton (Matthew Goode) (who is still working under Kitchener at the British War ministry)  whose ultimate goal is to achieve independence for Scotland; among its operatives is Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin (Rhys Ifans)  trusted adviser (The Tsar\'s personal physician) to Tsar Nicholas of Russia.On the Shepherd\'s orders  Rasputin poisons Tsar Nicholas\'s young son Alexei  only to cure him when Nicholas promises to stay out of the war. Conrad is notified of Rasputin\'s manipulation by his cousin  Prince Felix Yusupov (Aaron Vodovoz). Knowing the Western Front will be left vulnerable if Russia leaves the war  Conrad delivers this information to Kitchener and his aide-De-camp Major Max Morton  who set sail for Russia. Their ship is torpedoed by a submarine and sunk.Word of Kitchener\'s death reaches Orlando  spurring him (to first induct Conrad into his secret spy organization) to travel to Russia with Shola  Polly  and Conrad to deal with Rasputin once and for all. After a grueling close fight  Orlando  Shola  Conrad  and Polly successfully kill Rasputin during a Christmas party hosted by Prince Felix. Later that night  after celebrating his 19th birthday  Conrad expresses his determination to join the army  much to Orlando\'s dismay.At the Shepherd\'s orders  Erik Jan Hanussen (Daniel Bruhl) (An occultist and the Shepherd\'s second-in-command)  an adviser to Kaiser Wilhelm II  sends the Zimmermann Telegram (German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to the German Minister to Mexico  Heinrich Von Eckhardt  offering United States territory to Mexico in return for joining the German cause)  hoping to distract Britain and the United States. Although the message is intercepted by British intelligence and deciphered by Polly  President Woodrow Wilson refuses to join the war  citing a lack of concrete proof. The Shepherd recruits Vladimir Lenin and orders his Bolsheviks to overthrow the Tsar and remove Russia from the war  sending an assassin to kill the Romanovs.Now of age  Conrad is commissioned into the Grenadier Guards against his father\'s wishes  but Orlando persuades King George V (Tom Hollander) (Percival) to have him assigned to London. Determined to fight in the war  Conrad swaps places with a soldier named Archie Reid (Aaron Taylor-Johnson)  giving him the nickname  Lancelot  to send his father a message. Disguised as Archie  a member of the Black Watch  Conrad volunteers for a mission into No-Man\'s Land to retrieve information from a British agent wounded there. He is mistaken for a German spy (he gives his name as Archie Ried  but Archie mates say that they know Archie  and he ain\'t him) upon his return and executed at gunpoint  devastating Orlando  but the information he has recovered verifies the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram.After Wilson again refuses to enter the war despite Conrad\'s proof  Orlando learns that Wilson is being blackmailed with film footage showing him being seduced by the Shepherd\'s agent  Mata Hari (Valerie Pachner)  and resolves to recover it. Upon defeating Hari at the American embassy  Orlando has her cashmere scarf identified as being made from rare wool only found in a specific mountainous region. Pinpointing this location as the Shepherd\'s base of operations  Orlando  Shola  and Polly head there and fight their way inside. The Shepherd is revealed to be Morton  who had faked his own death and killed Kitchener himself.

Its source code was stolen from an unreleased game called Life Itself  developed by Walter  Keys  McKey and Millie Rusk  and used by Soonami\'s head developer Antwan Hovachelik to create Free City. Keys has since taken a job at Soonami  while Millie spends time within Free City as her avatar Molotov Girl to find evidence of code that she and Keys had written and to prove that they are the rightful owners of the code.In the game  Guy  a non-player character (NPC)  works as a bank teller and spends time with his best friend and co-worker  bank security guard Buddy  unaware that his world is a video game. One day  he encounters Molotov Girl  who is singing the song that he says his dream girl will like and begins to deviate from his programming. He takes a pair of sunglasses from a player who tries to rob his bank  through which he sees Free City from the player\'s head-up display (HUD). Guy speaks to Millie  who initially thinks he is another player named  Blue Shirt Guy  and not an NPC. She tells him to level up to above 100 before she will speak to him again. Keys and his coworker Mouser believe Guy to be a hacker disguised as an NPC and unsuccessfully attempt to ban him from the game. Rather than leveling up through destructive acts  Guy opts to perform good deeds  completing missions within Free City to reach level 102. His virtuous progression  which stands out from those of other players  results in  Blue Shirt Guy  becoming a worldwide sensation.Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash  another player\'s well-protected compound that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash  and Millie is bewildered when Guy wants to kiss her. Keys realizes that Guy is truly an NPC  and that his self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence (AI) code containing Millie\'s personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself  which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest in Millie. In addition  Guy\'s subsequent interactions with other NPCs have led them to develop self-awareness as well. Keys decides to help Millie retrieve their code before Free City is wiped from Soonami\'s servers to make way for its sequel  Free City 2  in two days. When Millie tells Guy the truth of his situation  Guy breaks off their relationship  telling her that he is in love with her. However  after talking with Buddy about the situation  Guy realizes that there was something more than love in their relationship and gains full sentience. Guy returns to Millie and agrees to help.Guy breaks into the Stash again with Buddy\'s help  where its owner  recognizing Guy  hands over the evidence. Guy\'s continued popularity threatens the launch of Free City 2  and Antwan orders Keys and Mouser to reboot the entire game  but Keys refuses and Antwan reboots the game himself.In the game  Millie finds Guy without any memories of his sentience  but recalling Keys\' advice that Guy would need a reminder  she kisses him. Guy\'s sentience is restored  and he recalls the location of the Island  part of Life Itself that will not be protected from the pending data wipe and which is the only proof of Millie and Keys\' original code. Antwan then tries to directly eliminate Guy and Molotov Girl from the game by raising their  wanted level  to maximum  but as Guy and Millie have persuaded the other NPCs in the game that they are more than their programming  they no longer respond to outside commands and refuse to interfere. Antwan then resorts to directly manipulating the game topography to kill Guy and Molotov Girl  while Keys makes his own changes to protect and direct them to the Island  broadcasting the effort to all of the Free City players who had been ejected from the game. Antwan fires Keys and then sends Dude  a muscular  unfinished copy of Guy developed for Free City 2  into the game. Unable to defeat him in direct combat  Guy puts his sunglasses onto Dude  the HUD distracting the far-less mature AI indefinitely.Antwan then enters Soonami\'s server room and begins destroying the game\'s servers with a fire axe in a last-ditch attempt to prevent his theft from being revealed  leading Mouser to discover Antwan\'s crimes and get fired  but Guy makes it to the Island before he can destroy the last one  an event that is seen by gamers all over the world. With the theft revealed  Antwan holds the remaining server hostage and demands that Millie abandon her lawsuit and surrender the Free City intellectual property (IP)  along with the profits from the game. Millie  believing the real value of the game is in its programming  enthusiastically agrees; the game\'s inhabitants are saved.Without Millie and Keys\' code  Free City 2 is a catastrophic failure at launch  Antwan is vilified by the media for his now-exposed crimes and he is arrested for theft and criminal damage. Keys  Mouser  and Millie start a successful new company with the recovered code to release Free Life  bringing Guy  Buddy  Dude  and the other Free City NPCs into it. Thanks to Guy  Millie realizes that Keys\' code was in fact a love letter to her  and they embrace and kiss. Guy reunites with Buddy  and they begin to live their own lives in Free Life without having to follow their original Free City coding.' , 'The world needed a hero. They got a guy.'

To restore his finances  Jean marries Marguerite de Thibouville  receiving a large dowry and the rights to many valuable estates. Pierre  however  has already gifted one piece of land to Jacques. When Jean sues for the land to be given to him  King Charles dismisses the suit. Pierre retaliates by appointing Jacques to the captaincy of a fort that Jean's family had held for generations. A military campaign in Scotland leaves Jean knighted for bravery but bankrupt. When he comes home from a visit to Paris  Marguerite tells him that Jacques raped her while she was home alone. Knowing that Pierre protects Jacques  Jean resolves to challenge him to a duel to the death  a request which Charles VI grants.\nChapter Two: The truth according to Jacques Le Gris.

Sometime later  Pierre informs Jacques that Jean is accusing him of raping Marguerite. Despite the count's attempt to exert his authority  Jean appeals his case directly to King Charles and requests a duel to the death.

Jacques haughtily declares his love for Marguerite; He forces his way into their bedroom where he violently rapes Marguerite. When Marguerite's husband returns  she tells him what happened.

At Jacques' trial  a now-pregnant Marguerite remains resolute that she is telling the truth. Charles VI grants Jean's request for a duel to the death. Marguerite confronts Jean for not telling her she would be burned alive if he failed. Marguerite gives birth to her son days before the duel is set to take place. The duel begins with Jean and Jacques jousting until both men lose their mounts and fight hand-to-hand. Jean is stabbed but eventually manages to pin down Jacques. He demands that Jacques confess or face damnation  but Jacques claims his innocence; Jean kills him.

In 2015  she made 148 tweets  which cover the bulk of her story.Aziah  Zola  King (Taylour Paige)  a self-assured waitress and part-time stripper in Detroit  meets Stefani (Riley Keough)  an outgoing and crass fellow stripper  while serving her at work. Stefani invites Zola to dance with her at a club that night  and the two form a quick friendship. The next day  Stefani proposes that Zola join her on a road trip to Tampa  Florida  the location of a strip club where Stefani claims the two can make significant money. Zola joins Stefani  her mysterious roommate  Abegunde  X  Olawale (Colman Domingo)  and Stefani\'s sheepish boyfriend  Derrek (Nicholas Braun)  on a road trip. Sean (Ari\'el Stachel) is Zola\'s boyfriend and she never tells him about the road-trip with Stefani.Upon arriving in Tampa  Stefani  Zola  and X leave Derrek at a seedy motel while they visit the club where Stefani claims her friends earned over $5 000 in one night. The two perform at the club  but do not net nearly as much as Stefani insisted they would. After  Zola learns that Stefani and X have posted photos (which Stefani took of Zola  while saying that she is simply taking some selfies) of her and Stefani in a Backpage (online site where you buy and sell sex) advertisement selling a night of sex with them. Zola attempts to leave  but is threatened by X  who reveals himself to be Stefani\'s pimp. X says he knows where Zola lives and unless she cooperates  she will be in danger.X brings the women to an upscale hotel  where Stefani proceeds to have sex with a male client. Zola again wanted to leave  but Stefani says she is also scared and is only doing this for her kid and doesn\'t want to be alone.\nZola  who does not wish to participate  is incredulous when she learns that X is charging only $150 per client (That is equivalent to about 20 mins on the pole  dancing). Zola edits the Backpage advertisement  changing the rate to $500 to help Stefani earn more money; by the end of the night  Stefani has made over $8 000.\nThe next morning  X is initially insulted by Zola\'s intervention  but quickly grows impressed. He throws some cash at Zola  as her share  but refuses to give any cut to Stefani  saying that he supports all her expenses and that\'s not cheap. Meanwhile  Derrek  left to his own devices  befriends a man named Dion (Jason Mitchell) whom he meets at the motel. When X  Stefani  and Zola return to the motel  X is enraged to discover that Derrek informed Dion about their reason for visiting Tampa. Worried that Dion and his associates will rob them  X forces the group to flee.After arriving at another hotel  X arranges for Stefani to see more clients at various locations  while a reluctant Zola stands by to ensure Stefani\'s safety. X gives Zola a cut from the earnings but warns her again of consequences if she tries to walk away.\nWhen Derrek realizes Stefani is again engaging in prostitution  he argues with her  revealing to Zola that Stefani has manipulated other dancers into unwittingly participating in similar prostitution rackets. Zola is angered and loses all trust in Stefani. Derrek and Stefani\'s quarreling is interrupted when X bursts in with Baybe (Sophie Hall)  his lover and madam  who is armed with a gun. After calming the situation  X gives Zola a gun for the women\'s protection  and Stefani and Zola are sent out so Stefani can continue to meet with clients.After Stefani engages in a gang bang at a private residence  the two women visit another hotel  where a client has responded to their Backpage ad. Upon opening the hotel room door  Stefani is grabbed by the client and forced into the room. A terrified Zola flees and calls X and Derrek on her phone. The three return to the room and find the men inside are Dion and an accomplice  armed with shotguns  who have posed as clients in order to rob Stefani of her earnings. Dion wants $20K & ownership of Stefani  as it turns out Dion is a pimp himself and is angry that X walked in on his turf.\nAt gunpoint  X offers possession of Zola & $50K  if they let him and Derrek leave with Stefani  who has been beaten unconscious. As Zola is digitally penetrated against her will by Dion  X manages to draw the gun Zola has in her purse  then shoots Dion in the throat. The group flee the hotel  disposing of Dion\'s guns by throwing them into the Tampa Bay.The group eventually arrives at a large  luxurious home X shares with Baybe. X finally allows Zola to leave and proclaims his possession of Stefani  but Derrek threatens to commit suicide should Stefani remain loyal to X. Derrek immediately throws himself over a balcony  landing on concrete below and injuring his head. Zola  Stefani  and X leave to take Derrek to the hospital.

She is an aspiring fashion designer who lives with her Granmother \'Gran Peggy\' (Rita Tushingham) and has been mourning the death of her mother (Aimee Cassettari)  who appears to Ellie in mirror reflections at times. Peggy shows Ellie a letter she has received informing her she has been accepted into a fashion school in London. Ellie is excited  but Peggy warns her that there are bad men up where she is going.Ellie takes a train to London and is driven to her room by a local taxi. The taxi driver (Colin Mace) makes creepy comments to Ellie  so she gets off at a shop and waits for the man to leave so she can keep walking to her room. She gets there and meets her roommate Jocasta (Synnove Karlsen).Ellie goes out with Jocasta and her friends  where it is revealed that Ellie\'s mother died by suicide after a struggle with mental illness. While in the ladies room  Ellie overhears Jocasta talking trash about her to the other girls. Ellie leaves the pub and walks back to her room  spotting an older man (Terence Stamp) looking her way and smirking. Jocasta later brings a guy back to her room to hook up with while Ellie tries to sleep. She leaves her room and finds a party going on outside. The only student to befriend her is a young man named John (Michael Ajao). The next morning  Ellie wakes up late and runs to class where she makes it on time for attendance.Ellie decides to find a place of her own for peace of mind. She finds a room in a boarding house kept by an old woman named Ms. Collins (Diana Rigg). She gives Ellie a set of rules to follow and allows her to stay in the bedroom upstairs. Ellie likes the place and rests for the night  sleeping all the way under the covers  enjoying the quiet.When Ellie gets out of bed  she finds herself somehow in the 1960\'s. She walks into a venue called Cafe de Paris and sees her reflection as another young woman named Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). Ellie follows Sandie as though she is there watching everything unfold like an invisible spirit. Sandie wants to be a singer at the venue but is met with unwanted attention by a surly patron (Paul Brightwell). She is told to speak to a man named Jack (Matt Smith) about being a singer. Sandie meets Jack and is charmed by him. He starts to leave with her when the patron makes rude comments. Jack punches him in the face and runs away with Sandie  kissing her in a phone booth  which is reflected as also happening with Ellie. As Ellie keeps moving  she finds Sandie in her bed  but when she tries to touch her  she wakes up back in the present.At school  Ellie becomes inspired to create a design based on what she saw Sandie wearing. Jocasta notes a hickey on Ellie\'s neck from where Jack had been kissing her/Sandie.Later that night  Ellie goes back to sleep hoping to wake up in the 60\'s again. She finds herself as Sandie and Jack get closer  and he brings Sandie to meet the owner of a different venue  the Rialto  so that she can sing for him  performing the song  Downtown . The men note that she can definitely sing.Back in the present  Ellie dyes her hair blonde like Sandie\'s and continues to work on her dress design  which her teacher seems to like  while Jocasta just mocks her out of pettiness. Ellie later sees the venue where she saw Sandie perform as it appears in the present day. She then goes to a pub to ask for a job. As she heads back to her room  the old man who saw her from the other night follows her and claims to recognize her because of her hair  but he insists he is not trying to pick her up.Ellie returns to the 60\'s and goes to the Rialto but finds Sandie is now performing as part of a group of skimpy-dressed women dancing as backup for a woman performing as a marionette. As Ellie follows Sandie around a little more  she sees that Jack is more abusive and is telling her that she has to make certain men happy if she wants to make it in the music business. Ellie sees Sandie in the bedroom as a lecherous man approaches her with his pants off. Ellie screams at the man to not touch Sandie  and he appears to hear her  but Ellie wakes up. The experience causes Ellie to rip up the pink dress design she originally drew in class.Ellie continues to get through work and school while keeping her excursions to the past a secret from everyone else. In her next trip to the 60\'s  she sees that Sandie is becoming more jaded and unhappy as Jack her forced her into prostitution and she must service a barrage of horrible men  while she also develops a drug and alcohol problem. She uses fake names like  Alex    Lexie   or  Anna . Only one man (Sam Claflin) does not take advantage of her and is polite and charming to her. Sandie talks down about herself while Ellie tries to get her attention through the mirror. She manages to smash through the glass and grab Sandie  but she wakes up.John sees that Ellie is looking a bit unwell  so he invites her out to a Halloween party. Jocasta and her friends see them together and give them drinks. They all start dancing  but in the middle of things  Ellie hallucinates seeing ghoulish visions of the men who took advantage of Sandie  as well as Sandie herself dancing alone. John takes Ellie home when he sees her looking bad. They start to kiss and go to her room for sex  but Ellie looks up and sees the ceiling mirror showing Jack attacking Sandie. Ellie starts yelling at him to get off her. She then appears to see Jack stabbing Sandie to death. Ms. Collins overhears the noise and orders John to leave  as one of her rules is not having male visitors. She simply tells Ellie to go to bed.The next day  Ellie apologizes to Ms. Collins about what happened. She asks her if anyone died in her room but Ms. Collins is dodgy about it. Later  Ellie goes to the library to look up murders in the 60\'s. She begins to hallucinate the ghost men following her around the library  nearly leading her to stab Jocasta in the face with a pair of scissors. John runs after Jocasta to explain things while Ellie leaves in a panic. She runs to the police station to report the murder  now believing that the old man is Jack and that he got away with killing Sandie  but the detectives know she has little to go off of.Ellie arrives late for work and finds that the old man is waiting for her. She takes out her mobile phone to try and record a confession out of him  but when she brings up Sandie  the man says  Alex killed Sandie  and that whatever happened to her was something she got herself into. Ellie runs after the man  but he gets hit by a car on the street and dies. Ellie\'s boss tells someone to call for help and say he\'s a former cop named Lindsay. Ellie realizes the man is not Jack  but rather the gentleman who was polite with her and didn\'t sleep with her.Ellie returns to her room and makes plans to go back home in the countryside to live with her grandmother. Ms. Collins gives Ellie tea and her mail. One letter is addressed to Ms. Collins  revealing her name to be Alexandra.... which is what Sandie told Jack her name was short for. Ms. Collins reveals that someone did die in Ellie\'s room: her. Ms. Collins was Sandie. After enduring all the abuse in her life  she let her life as Sandie die when she stabbed Jack to death. She later got revenge on all the men who abused her by murdering them. Ms. Collins then reveals that she poisoned Ellie\'s tea and will make it look like a suicide. John then comes looking for Ellie  who regains enough strength to warn John to run. Ms. Collins stabs him while Ellie tries to run upstairs  seeing the younger Sandie attacking her. Downstairs  a fire starts and begins spreading. Ellie locks herself in her room where the spirits of Sandie\'s victims break through the floors and walls  begging Ellie to kill Ms. Collins. When she finally breaks in  she sees her reflection as Sandie and realizes she has become just as much of a monster as the men who hurt her. She tries to slit her throat but Ellie stops her and tries to help her. Ms. Collins chooses to stay and die in the fire while letting Ellie go. Ellie gets John out of there as medics arrive  and Ms. Collins allows the flames to consume her.Sometime later  Ellie presents her work in a fashion show with Peggy and John in attendance to cheer her on along with the rest of the audience. Her teacher congratulates her  as do the other girls (excluding Jocasta who continues to remain a petty bitch)  and she once again sees her mother\'s reflection smiling at her. As Peggy and John come to congratulate her  Ellie sees Sandie\'s reflection in the mirror waving at her.' , 'A murder in the past. A mystery in the future.'  'Dreams really do come true.'

A scouting mission is sent  although the 86-year flight means that the grandchildren of the launch crew astronauts will be the ones who reach the planet. To help the launch crew cope with the knowledge that their remaining lives will likely be spent mostly in flight  the original 30 are bred through IVF and kept in isolation from the rest of the world. In order to extend their time in flight  they are launched on the Humanitas spaceship as pre-teens  with a single adult  senior program commander Richard  to guide them through the early part of the journey. To conserve resources  the plan is for IVF to be performed when the crew turns 24  to be repeated on those offspring when they turn 24.During the tenth year of the flight  Christopher and Zac discover that the grown teenagers are being given a blue chemical in their food to suppress sex drive and pleasure response  keeping them all docile and manageable. The pair stops taking the chemical  and their surging hormones drive them to become competitive  careless  and anxious to engage in sexual relations  specifically with their crew mate Sela  who has been trained to be the chief medical officer.During a repair effort outside the Humanitas to address a failed Earth communication system  Richard  who has been serving as chief officer  is killed  apparently by an unseen entity  and a fire damages more ship systems. Christopher is voted the new chief officer  which upsets Zac  who then tells the others to stop ingesting the chemical. The mission descends into madness  as many of the young men and women revert to their most primal state.Zac tells the others that an alien killed Richard  that he will protect them and let them eat all the (closely conserved) food they want  and convinces all but five to follow him rather than Christopher. Christopher and Sela  who have become a couple  find and repair a video disk that reveals that Zac killed Richard  precipitating the further systems damage  by turning on the electricity to the communications array while Richard was working on it. They show the others  but Zac still convinces many that an alien is inhabiting one of them  leading many to follow Zac in vigilante murders of anyone he targets.Christopher inadvertently leads Zac to a hidden compartment on the ship  which proves to be weapons for their grandchildren to use on the planet. Christopher  Sela  and Phoebe are the only holdouts. Phoebe is killed  and the pack searches for Christopher and Sela. The pair tricks Zac into being ejected into space  and peace returns to Humanitas. Sela is then voted chief officer. The crew decides to permanently forgo the blue chemical and learn to manage their natural emotions  as well as falling in love and having children naturally  instead of via IVF as had been originally planned.Decades later  Humanitas and its multi-generational crew arrive at the planet  which appears from orbit to be as earth-like as had been hoped.

Ezekiel  Zeke  Banks a new partner  idealistic rookie William Schenk.

Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible  due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station  containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk\'s tattooed skin inside.

He also reveals that Marcus  during his time as chief  deliberately protected corrupt officers (including Garza) in order to  clean  the streets of crime more efficiently.Believing that Banks can be an ally  Emerson presents him with a final test  revealing Marcus restrained in the air and slowly being drained of blood. Emerson calls 9-1-1 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter  resulting in the dispatcher sending a SWAT team to his location. He hands Banks a revolver with a single bullet  and offers him the choice to either use the last bullet to shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emerson to escape  or to kill Emerson and let his father bleed to death. Banks decides to shoot the target to save Marcus  causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground  and then begins to fight Emerson.

Among the attendees is Diana Spencer  Princess of Wales (Kristen Stewart)  whose marriage to Prince Charles (Jack Farthling) has become strained due to his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. As the size-able staff of Sandringham  led by the capable Major Alistair Gregory (Timothy Spall)  prepare for the royals\' arrival  Diana drives around the Norfolk countryside in her convertible sports car. On the verge of a mental breakdown  she avoids heading to Sandringham until running into Royal Head Chef Darren McGrady (Sean Harris). She notes that the long-abandoned neighboring estate  Park House  used to be her childhood home. Then she notices a scarecrow in the distance and eagerly runs toward it with a nostalgic expression. Diana takes off its jacket  which once belonged to her father John Spencer  8th Earl Spencer  and goes back to her car.When Diana arrives at Sandringham  her sons William (Jack Nielen) and Harry (Freddie Spry) are excited to see her  but she does not attempt to socialize with the royal family  who mostly ignore her. Diana\'s only real friend at the Estate is Royal Dresser Maggie (Sally Hawkins)  who encourages her to both combat the royal family and fulfill the obligations expected of her. Diana finds a book on Anne Boleyn in her assigned bedroom. She begins to have dreams about Boleyn (including a hallucination of her at a Christmas Eve dinner where she imagines herself destroying a pearl necklace given to her by Charles and eating the pearls in her soup)  eventually coming to believe that Boleyn\'s ghost is haunting her in her capacity as a fellow abandoned royal wife. Diana tries to visit her childhood home but is stopped by royal guards  who initially mistake her for an intruder.Christmas DayDiana attends the service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham  where she notices Camilla among the gathered crowd and is photographed by numerous intrusive journalists. Afterwords  Diane holds a difficult conversation with Charles  who rebuffs her concern over William and Harry\'s participation in a pheasant shoot the next day and advises her to develop a stronger sense of separation between her public and private lives.Charles privately arranges for Maggie to be sent to London and spreads rumors that she had planted the Boleyn book in Diana\'s room and made critical comments about her mental health; McGrady denies that she had done so when Diana questions him. Major Gregory attempts to encourage Diana to conform to the pressures of royal life by reminding her that the soldiers of the British Army die attempting to protect the interests of the Crown (and by extension her interests); Diana responds by stating that she never asked anyone to die for her.After imagining wounding herself with a pair of wire-cutters given to her by McGrady  Diana avoids the formal Christmas Day dinner  instead running to her childhood home and gaining access to it with the wire-cutters. Memories of her happier girlhood overtake her  and she dances from room to room while imagining her younger selves. She considers committing suicide by throwing herself down a flight of stairs  but the hallucination of Boleyn stops her. Instead  she rips apart her pearl necklace.Boxing DayDiana wakes up in her room to find that Maggie has been called back from London. The two travel to a nearby beach  where Diana talks about her mental and marital problems. Maggie responds by confessing that she is in love with Diana  which she politely rebuffs Maggie\'s advances.After bidding Maggie farewell  Diana goes to the pheasant shoot  walks out in front of the crowd of hunters  and announces that she is taking William and Harry to London  to which Charles reluctantly agrees. Diana bids farewell to McGrady and Major Gregory returns the Boleyn book to the library.

They live in Mexico. Someone close to her calls and warns her that the cartel is after her  so she and Miguel need to flee immediately. The cartel leader Mauricio Guerrero (Juan Pablo Raba) has captured Rosa's brother Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz)  since he stole money from them  and he warns Carlos that his family is next before they hang his body by an overpass.In Arizona  retired former marine Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) is working by the U.S.-Mexico border to keep an eye out for undocumented migrants attempting to cross. He spots a few near him and reports it. As he follows  he sees that one is injured and gives him water before calling someone to bring medical assistance.Jim's home is put up for foreclosure  and he doesn't have many work options. He lives alone with his dog Jackson  but his closest company is his stepdaughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick)  who is a police officer. They are both missing her mother since she passed away  and Sarah takes Jim home from the bar and puts him to bed.When Jim goes to the border the next day  he comes across Rosa and Miguel trying to make it past the fence once Mauricio and his goons make their presence aware. Jim attempts to report them to Border Patrol  but Mauricio and two other men step out of their vehicle. After realizing that they are a threat  Jim tries to have Rosa and Miguel hide  so Mauricio's guys begin to open fire. Jim returns fire and hits Mauricio's brother  killing him. He gets Rosa and Miguel in the truck and starts to drive away as Mauricio chases the vehicle on foot. Jim shakes him off and gets away. Mauricio then makes a call to reinforcements.After they get far enough  Miguel sees that Rosa was shot. Jim takes her out and lays her down as she is dying. She gives Jim a bag of stolen money and an address  requesting to Jim that he take Miguel to family in Chicago. Jim then waits as medics and other officers arrive to retrieve Miguel. He is told by another officer that Miguel blames Jim for his mother's death.When Jim sees the money in Rosa's bag  he feels compelled to return for the boy. He learns from someone at the station that Miguel will be deported and go back with a family member  but Jim also sees Mauricio and his men waiting in a van outside. Jim tricks the officer at the front to let him see Miguel  and he smuggles the boy out of the station. Mauricio notices and follows. Jim returns home briefly to get Jackson and his guns before heading forward.Mauricio and his guys make it to Jim's home to gather personal information  and he also steals a marine pin from Jim before they burn his house down. The gang members then set up shop nearby where one of Mauricio's men tracks Jim's credit card information.Jim stops at a gas station and picks up an atlas to get to Chicago. Not long after they leave  Mauricio and his men stop at the gas station where he intimidates the gas station clerk (Amber Midthunder) that tended to Jim. He looks at security footage to find him before killing the clerk  and they continue to pursue.Jim gets food for him and Miguel before returning to the road  but the truck breaks down from overheating. He stops at a nearby shop and uses money to get it patched while sleeping in the truck for the night. Miguel takes Jackson out for a walk and uses some money to get supplies. Sarah has also become aware of what Jim has done and contacts him to return Miguel  but he stresses that the situation is life or death.After returning to the road  Jim is pulled over by a trooper (Vic Browder) who asks him to step out of the vehicle after he confiscates his weapons. The trooper claims to want to talk to Miguel  but Jim notices the man talking on the phone to someone else. When Jim points this out to the trooper  he quickly realizes he is working under the cartel and that he has sold them out. The trooper draws his gun on Jim  but Jackson bites his arm and helps Jim overpower him. Jim knocks the trooper out and goes with Miguel and Jackson to hide as Mauricio and the others come by. After seeing that their targets have fled  he kills the trooper and they take Jim's guns.Jim stops at a gun store to get more guns and later stops at a motel for the night after thinking it was safe since he didn't use his card. Mauricio and his goons kill the motel clerk before going to find Jim and Miguel. He gets the boy and hides after alerting the cops. They hide long enough before the cops arrive  but Mauricio sees Jackson and shoots him before leaving. Jim gets his dog's body and gives him a proper burial in the morning.Jim feels that he should just take Miguel back to Mexico  but after another talk with Sarah  he decides he has to finish the job. Sarah even decides to cover for him and not let her colleagues know where Jim is headed. Jim and Miguel stop on the side of the road for the night where Jim shows Miguel how to use a gun  and they also burn the cartel money to stay warm.Nearing their destination  Jim sees Mauricio and his goons have found them and are getting close. Jim manages to shake them briefly to give him enough time to get a spot to snipe them. He shoots the driver and causes their van to crash before taking Miguel to hide on a nearby farm. He shoots the youngest member before Mauricio and the other member follow. Miguel creates a diversion to allow Jim to shoot the last member before Mauricio goes after them. He finds Miguel and holds him at gunpoint to lure Jim to him. He tells Jim he plans to recruit Miguel as a child soldier like he was  even trying to get Miguel to pull the trigger on Jim himself. Using what he learned from Jim  Miguel empties the magazine and has Jim fight Mauricio. He gets stabbed in the process  but when Miguel gets the gun  he hands it to Jim  and he shoots Mauricio in the stomach. He leaves him the gun with one bullet to give him his next choice.

In the store we see rocket space toys. The shop keeper is watching the news  where an extraordinary bomb in China is being reported. Lee then walks through the street to a park where his wife  Evelyn (Emily Blunt)  is pushing youngest son Beau on a swing. The Abbott family are there to watch a baseball game in which eldest son Marcus is playing. Lee sits next to Regan (his eldest child  and only daughter  who is deaf) on the stalls and says hi to his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy)  who is sat behind them with his youngest son. Emmett\'s eldest son bats the ball and makes a home run. As he runs to the final base the crowd and Emmett are shouting \'dive!\' as the fielders are close. After this Emmett asks Regan how to say \'Dive\' and she signals a diving motion with her hands in American Sign Language. Beau and Evelyn wish Marcus good luck as he goes up to bat. Marcus misses the first two balls  then is distracted by a large meteor in the sky. The game stops and everyone starts heading back to their cars / homes. Regan goes with her dad and Evelyn takes the boys. The aliens are already here though and start attacking the street and killing lots of people.\nDay 474The film cuts to moments after the events of A Quiet Place 1  the Abbott family leaves their home barefoot. (By this point  day 472-473  Evelyn has given birth to a baby boy  Lee was killed protecting Marcus and Regan from an alien  the house is both on fire and flooding and Evelyn has just killed several aliens with the help of Regan\'s cochlea implant feedback noise amplified by a speaker which weakens the aliens. Beau died on day 89 due to taking a space rocket toy from the store at the beginning of a Quiet Place 1  the sound of the toy attracted an alien who quickly attacked).Just before leaving the farm  Evelyn tells Marcus and Regan to \'stay there\' whist she quietly heads back into the flooded cellar and tries to stay quiet as she swims in search of an oxygen tank. Meanwhile Regan tells Marcus she\'s going back to the house  and leaves Marcus with the baby. Regan collects the amplifier and microphone. She uses her clipper to cut a cord off the amplifier. Regan and Evelyn individually return and the family walk along the sandy path Lee had created until they reach the furthest point  and then they quietly step onto the dry leaves and continue their trek. Evelyn and Regan carry the baby in a trunk sound proofed with blankets and the oxygen tank is feeding a baby respiratory mask so that the trunk lid can be closed.The family reach a wire fence with an opening. As Evelyn walks through  her bag gets caught and a small sound is made  she looks behind her concerned about the noise and unknowingly triggers a trip wire that causes a bundle of bottles to fall and jangle. Evelyn whispers to Marcus and Regan  RUN . Meanwhile we cut perspective to a the view point through a gun aim that has been fixed on the family. An alien starts chasing the family.Whilst running  Marcus gets injured by a bear trap  which he handles silently until he sees his injured foot and lets out a primal scream. Evelyn tries to stop him screaming whilst Regan uses the amp  microphone and cochlear implant hearing aid to to create feedback that is unbearable to the alien. Evelyn shoots the alien in the head as it struggles against the sound.The family head inside a nearby derelict building. As they walk round a corner a man grabs Evelyn  puts his hand over Evelyn\'s mouth and signals shh while pointing to an alien on the ceiling. The man leads the family to a sound proof vault underground. A towel over the latch of the vault reduces noise and prevents the latch locking the door from the inside. He starts a timer on a stop watch and after a few minutes opens the door to let in air.Once safe  he tells the family they can\'t stay - there isn\'t enough food or water. Evelyn thinks she recognizes the man and says  \'Emmett?\' - to which Emmett unmasks his face from the scarf and baseball cap he\'d been wearing. He reiterates they can\'t stay. Evelyn asks about Emmett\'s children and he explains his sons died on Day 1.Evelyn asks after Lola  his wife. He explains Lola died 11 weeks ago  that she got sick and they moved down to the sound proof basement of this derelict warehouse once the pain was too bad and she was screaming. Emmett says \'I couldn\'t do enough\'.Evelyn asks if Emmett would see the fires lit by Lee each night and if \'he knew it was him  Lee ?\'. Emmett says he did. Evelyn asks why didn\'t he didn\'t come for them  since they were friends. (In A Quiet Place 1 the Abbot family had not had any contact from anyone and heard no radio signals despite searching and searching  very few survivors were left on Earth). Emmett explains that the people left  \'you don\'t know  do you? ...they\'re not people worth saving\'. Regan signs and whispers \'you\'re nothing like him  Lee !\' to Emmett.Regan goes to her brother who is lying down to rest having had his ankle painfully dressed (in the vault to mute his screams). Regan gives Marcus headphones and plays radio white noise to him  scrolling through the frequencies. Suddenly Marcus hears music and sits bolt upright. Regan stops turning the dial and Evelyn rushes over. Marcus whispers \'music!\' and Evelyn listens. Shocked she turns to Emmet who explains yes it\'s just the song \'Across The Sea\' on a loop  that\'s all it ever does. Regan signs that he is a liar telling her mum that \'Dad would have heard it  he would have told us\'. Emmett explains that you can\'t hear that signal down in the valley (where the Abbotts lived) - he and Lola only discovered it when they moved up here.Regan works out the signal originates from an island nearby  about 1 day\'s walk away. In the middle of the night she wakes Marcus and they go to the sound proof vault to talk. Regan attempts to convince Marcus to help her find a way to the radio tower  by following railway tracks to the coast then finding a boat. She wants to get to the station so that she can use the station to transmit the high frequency noise her hearing aid produces  that exposes weak spots on the aliens. In this way anyone (including the family) can use a radio to play the high pitch noise and protect themselves from the aliens - a significant step towards a better way of life. Marcus is very worried and does not want Regan to go. Regan insists she has to try because that\'s what Dad would have done. Regan is forced to venture out on her own very early in the morning after Marcus threatens to tell Mum (Evelyn). She leaves a note on the radio saying \'keep listening\'.In the morning  after discovering that Regan has gone  Evelyn pleas Emmett to go after her and bring her back. He eventually agrees when Evelyn says that she wishes Lee was here to look him in the eye and tell him Regan is exactly the type of person worth saving.Meanwhile Regan comes across a train station with a derailed train and climbs aboard the front carriage  which is the only one still on the train track. There are several dead bodies  skeletons. She needs a first aid kit and finds one in the driver booth but struggles to open the door. She eventually reaches the box and takes it but the skeleton of the dead driver falls on her causing a fright and she screams. An alien shortly arrives and Regan is trapped struggling to hold the hearing aid to the microphone in one hand and operate the shotgun in the other. Luckily Emmett arrives and shoots the creature.They hide in near by station office due to fear the noise will have attracted more aliens. Emmett explains he is here to take her home. Regan is not happy and says \'what  home \'. Regan explains her plan to Emmett  and says that before when his wife died there wasn\'t anything he could do but now there is. Emmett decides to help her complete the mission.Back at Emmett\'s base  Evelyn has to leave Marcus and the baby to get supplies they require - medicine for Marcus\' foot and more oxygen tanks for the baby for when the baby is in the trunk. Marcus is very scared and doesn\'t want her to go. Evelyn explains his foot will get worse and she can\'t lose him too. Marcus understands and let\'s her go.She walks back to the sand path and follows the route she and the family uses to get to the store (where Lee bought oranges on Day 1). Along the way she passes the bridge where Beau died where a make-shift shrine is. She touched the photographs crying  and places her wedding ring on top of the cross.Back at base  after getting the baby to sleep  Marcus exits the bunker and explores the compound. The camera cuts to the baby\'s oxygen tank the gauge for which is in the red zone  since its is running low. Heading upstairs  Marcus finds a room covered in drawings of Emmett\'s sons. Behind some curtains separating a section of the room he finds a dead body half composed (probably Lola) lying in a bed. This startles him and he accidentally knocks a few objects over  alerting a nearby alien to his location.He runs back to the basement  grabs the baby and puts him in the vault  he then steps out again to grab the stopwatch and radio and  as the alien approaches  he is able to get into the vault and close the door. The towel is not over the latch and the door locks shut unbeknownst to Marcus.By nightfall Emmett and Regan reach some docks and look for a boat they can take to reach the island. They find a little girl at the end of the pontoon. Emmett goes up to her and she suddenly traps him in a noose. Several feral people appear who tie netting with bottles around Emmett and begin to search Regan for supplies. They take her hearing aid and rucksack full of supplies  then begin to lead her away. Emmett signs \'dive\' to Regan  then he wriggles opens the netting making lots of noise and grabs the man who took Regan\'s hearing aid. Several aliens appear and attack the docks  killing a number of feral people. Emmett is still holding the man and an alien comes to attack due to the noise of the bottles. Emmett dives into the water and the feral man is killed by the alien. The alien then hears Emmett swimming in the water  and jumps after him  only to drown as it cannot swim. Emmett is still tied to the dock and struggles to remove the noose from his neck. A small boat comes by and Regan\'s hand reaches out to him. He climbs aboard and opens his mouth to reveal Regan\'s hearing aid. They remove the noose and we see their boat heading to the island. In the corner of the screen an alien is stranded on top of a boat that has detached from the docks during the chaos.Marcus is struggling to breathe and sees from the watch that he needs to open the door. He struggles with the door and eventually  distraught  gives up. He opens the baby\'s trunk to find the baby screaming. With a pained expression he starts sharing the oxygen with the baby  until he falls asleep.Meanwhile Evelyn returns to compound with the supplies and here\'s an alien making a loud cry. She tries to explode the alien by shooting an oxygen tank but the alien is unscathed. The explosion does  however  trigger the fire sprinklers. The noise of the sprinklers helps Evelyn navigate around the alien and return to the basement. The alien does chase her though. Evelyn hides inside the bunker with Marcus and the infant  with the alien waiting outside the door for them.Regan and Emmett approach the island  where they find a colony of people living normal lives after isolating themselves to the island. After the government realized the creatures could not swim  the National Guard had as many people as possible put on the islands. However  one of the creatures manages to get to the island on another boat and kills several civilians. However  they lure the creature away to where the radio station is  and it follows them inside. The alien eventually hears Regan and Emmett  slicing Emmett with its claws. However  as it goes after Regan  she is able to change the sound coming from the station from the song to the noise her hearing aid produced weakening the creature  as she eventually kills it with a pole. Marcus  picking up the signal through the radio  also uses the noise to weaken the creature  shooting it dead  now allowing anyone to be able to kill the creatures.' , 'Silence is Not Enough'

Twenty years later  the boy has grown into a talented and deadly martial arts fighter  driven by a desire to avenge his father. To conceal his true identity  he calls himself  Snake Eyes  (Henry Golding)  a name inspired when his father\'s murderer forced him to roll a pair of weighted dice to determine his fate  killing him when he rolled double ones.Wealthy Yakuza boss Kenta Takamura (Takehiro Hira) discovers Snake Eyes in an underground fighting circuit located in Los Angeles. Kenta offers to find his father\'s killer if Snake Eyes will work for him  to which Snake Eyes accepts. When Snake Eyes is asked to prove his loyalty by shooting a man who betrayed Kenta\'s trust (Kenta accuses him of being an undercover spy)  Snake Eyes refuses (Tommy had been kind and fair to Snake Eyes in Kenta\'s organization  unlike the rest of his troops) and instead helps the traitor escape. Tommy wants to kill Kenta and refuses to escape without killing him. Snake Eyes has to intervene multiple times to keep Tommy safe and eventually Kenta has to back off when the police arrive. Snake Eyes is stabbed in the attacks.The traitor is Kenta\'s cousin  Tomisaburo  Tommy  Arashikage (Andrew Koji). Tommy and Kenta were both in line to lead the Arashikage clan  an ancient ninja society devoted to preserving order and fighting evil. Kenta sought to kill his cousin  but failed and was banished. Kenta was therefore smuggling guns into Japan  via US  to stage a coup against the clan and Tommy was undercover to stop him.Grateful to Snake Eyes  Tommy takes him to his ninja Dojo in Tokyo  Japan and asks that he be initiated as a member. The current Clan Arashikage leader  Sen (Eri Ishida)  Tommy\'s grandmother  agrees to let Snake Eyes undergo three trials to determine if he is worthy. Hard Master (Iko Uwais)  A formidable mentor of the Arashikage clan and the uncle of Tommy. Blind Master (Peter Mensah)  A blind mentor of the Arashikage clan.The clan\'s head of security  Akiko (Haruka Abe)  does not trust Snake Eyes at first  but he wins her trust by revealing his father\'s murder and explains that is why there is no recorded history of him. Unbeknownst to anyone  Snake Eyes plans to betray his new allies. Tommy\'s attempted murder and escape is shown to have been staged by Kenta in order to get Snake Eyes close enough to steal the clan\'s most sacred treasure  the  Jewel of the Sun   which has magical powers.\nTommy tells Snake Eyes that the jewel was a gift from the Sun God and the clan is sworn never to use it  even to kill evil  and to only protect it.Snake Eyes finds himself increasingly torn between his guilt over betraying Tommy  the clan  and his overwhelming desire for revenge. He passes the first two trials with his exceptional talents. First trial is to snatch a bowl of water from Hard master\'s hands in combat  without spilling your own bowl of water  in 4 attempts. Snake Eyes fights and loses 3 times and then finally succeeds by simply asking Hard Master to exchange their bowls of water.The 2nd test is an illusion that brings Snake Eyes face to face with his father\'s killers on that night when they burnt his house down. Snake Eyes is furious and attacks but is gunned down. He is approached by his father  who tells him it was not his fault  as he was just a kid. Snake Eyes unburdens himself of the guilt of his father\'s death.Snake Eyes and Tommy learn that Kenta is back in Tokyo and aligning with the terrorist revolutionary organization Cobra. Snake Eyes meets Kenta again  in secret  and says he has no intention to work for terrorists. Kenta explains to Snake Eyes that he is tasked to steal the jewel on behalf of Cobra. Cobra  through their liaison  the Ana DeCobray / Baroness (Ursula Corber??)  has been arming Kenta with weapons so that he can seize control of the Arashikage clan. Kenta and Baroness inform Snake Eyes that they have his father\'s murderer imprisoned and will release him if Snake does not secure the jewel for them.The third and final trial requires his spirit to be tested by sacred anacondas  who can sense if he is truly pure of heart. Due to Snake Eyes\' secrets  the snakes attack him  but Akiko saves him from being killed. Confronted by the clan  Snake Eyes admits that he has not been entirely honest but manages to hide the true reason he is there and is expelled.\nSnake Eyes later returns in secret and steals the jewel using his knowledge of the clan\'s temple  delivering it to Kenta. Kenta tastes the magic of the jewel and promises to hand it over to Cobra once he has destroyed the Arashikage clan.\nSnake Eyes receives his reward for stealing the jewel: his father\'s killer  who turns out to be a Cobra agent. Having realized what his blood-lust has cost him  Snake Eyes spares the man and instead goes back to the Arashikage clan to warn them of Kenta\'s attack.Tommy puts aside his anger and let\'s Snake Eyes assist him and the clan\'s warriors  including Major O\'Hara / Scarlett (Samara Weaving)  a member of the international peacekeeping organization G.I. Joe  in fighting off Kenta\'s men. Baroness helps Kenta corner Sen and the clan is effectively defeated.

When the carnival geek becomes sick  carnival owner Clem enlists Stan to help him dispose of him. Stan is disturbed at how any man could sink to the level of performing as a geek  living in a cage in squalor and biting off the heads of live chickens to appease the crowd. Clem explains that he seeks out alcoholic or drug-addicted men with troubled pasts  and lures them in with promises of a  temporary  job and opium-laced alcohol. He then uses their dependence on alcohol to keep them around  then makes a speech about how he needs a  real  geek and lets them consider quitting  which would mean severe withdrawal from the drugs; the result  he says  is that they choose to stay. He shows Stan where he stores the moonshine he brews to control some of the carnies  but warns him not to mistake it for the wood alcohol he stores nearby. Stan works with clairvoyant act  Madame Zeena  and her alcoholic husband  Pete. Zeena and Pete use cold reading and an ingenious coded language system to make it appear that she has extraordinary mental powers  which Pete begins teaching to Stan. He and Zeena warn Stan not to ever use these skills to continue leading patrons on when it comes to the dead  what they call a  spook show ; they always inform customers afterward that the show is a deception  otherwise people get hurt. Meanwhile  Stan becomes attracted to fellow performer Molly  and approaches her with an idea for a two-person act away from the carnival. One night  Stan accidentally gives Pete the wrong bottle and the old man dies from consuming wood alcohol. In the aftermath  Stan swears his love to Molly and reiterates his plan to her. She accepts and they leave the carnival behind. Two years later  Stan has successfully reinvented himself as  The Great Stanton   a psychic act for the wealthy urban elite of Chicago  along with Molly as his assistant  using Zeena and Pete\'s techniques. During a performance  their act is interrupted by psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter  who attempts to expose their code system. Stan\'s cold reading allows him to best Ritter  keeping their act safe. He is later approached by the wealthy Judge Harrington  who employed Ritter to test Stan. He is now convinced of Stan\'s abilities and offers to pay him handsomely to allow him and his wife to communicate with their dead son. Despite Molly\'s objections to the  spook show   Stan agrees. Ritter invites Stan to her office. Knowing he is a con man  she is nevertheless intrigued by his manipulative skill. Through her recorded sessions with her clients  she has accumulated sensitive information about various members of Chicago\'s social elite. Finding themselves to be kindred spirits  she and Stanton begin an affair and they conspire together to manipulate Harrington  with Ritter secretly providing private information to fuel his charade. She also begins therapy sessions with Stan  who reveals his guilt over Pete\'s death  and his hatred of his alcoholic father  who he killed in their home before joining the carnival. Harrington introduces Stan to the powerful Ezra Grindle. Grindle wishes to speak to his long lost illegitimate lover  Dory  who died of a forced miscarriage. Despite warnings from Ritter that Grindle is dangerous  Stan begins scamming Grindle and begins drinking. Molly becomes increasingly uncomfortable  and upon learning of the affair with Ritter  leaves Stan. He begs her to stay  but she refuses  only agreeing to help him one last time. She poses as Dory for Stan\'s ultimate act: conjuring Dory from afar for Grindle. However  he loses control of Grindle  who grabs Molly and reveals himself to be a violent abuser of women  plagued by his guilt over Dory. Upon realizing that  Dory  is a fake  he violently threatens Stan  who kills him. They flee and Molly leaves Stan for good. Stan goes to Ritter for help  but discovers she has been scamming him all along  keeping the money for herself.

According to the wishes expressed in his will  publication of the magazine is immediately suspended. A scene shows Howitzer and his editorial staff discussing the publication of the following four magazine pieces.The Cycling ReporterHerbsaint Sazerac delivers a cycling tour of the town of Ennui-sur-Blas??  demonstrating several key areas such as the arcade  Le Sans Blague caf?? and a pick-pocket\'s alleyway. He compares the past and the present of each place  demonstrating how much and yet how little has changed in Ennui over time.The Concrete MasterpieceJ.K.L. Berensen delivers a lecture at the art gallery of her former employer  Upshur  Maw  Clampette  in which she details the career of Moses Rosenthaler. Rosenthaler  a mentally disturbed artist serving a sentence in the Ennui prison for murder  paints an abstract nude portrait of Simone  a prison officer with whom he develops a burgeoning relationship. Julien Cadazio  an art dealer also serving a sentence for tax evasion  is immediately taken by the painting and buys it despite Rosenthaler\'s protests. Upon his release  Cadazio convinces his family of art exhibitors to put it on display  and Rosenthaler soon becomes a sensation in the art world. Privately  Rosenthaler struggles with inspiration  and devotes himself to a long-term project.Three years later  Cadazio  his uncles  Clampette  Berensen  and a mob of artists inspired by Rosenthaler  all frustrated at the lack of further paintings  bribe their way into the prison to confront him  only to discover that his masterpiece is in fact a series of frescoes in the concrete prison hall. Angered that the paintings are irremovable from the prison  Cadazio gets into a physical altercation with Rosenthaler  but soon comes to appreciate the paintings for what they are  and later arranges for the entire room to be airlifted out of the prison into a private museum in Kansas  owned by Clampette. For his actions in halting a prison riot that breaks out during the reveal of the paintings  Rosenthaler is released on probation. Simone and Rosenthaler maintain correspondence following his release.Revisions to a ManifestoLucinda Krementz reports on a student protest breaking out in the streets of Ennui that soon boils over into the  Chessboard Revolution . While the revolution initially is inspired by petty concerns over access to the girls dormitory  the traumatic military conscription of one student  Mitch-Mitch  inspires greater uprising. The students\' cause spreads to the working people of Ennui-sur-Blas??.Despite her insistence on maintaining  journalistic neutrality   Krementz has a brief romance with Zeffirelli  a self-styled leader of the revolt  and secretly helps him write his manifesto and adds an appendix. Juliette  a fellow revolutionary  is unimpressed with his manifesto. After they briefly express their disagreement about its contents  Krementz tells the two to  go make love   which they do.A few weeks later  Zeffirelli is killed attempting repairs on the tower of a revolutionary pirate radio station  and soon a photograph of his likeness becomes symbolic of the movement. Years later  Krementz adapts the story of Mitch-Mitch\'s conscription  and Zeffirelli and Juliette\'s relationship  for a play at the National Theatre.The Private Dining Room of the Police CommissionerDuring a television interview  Roebuck Wright recounts the story of his attending a private dinner with The Commissaire of the Ennui police force  prepared by legendary police officer/chef Lt. Nescaffier. Nescaffier is a famous specialist in a kind of haute cuisine specifically designed to be eaten by working police officers. The dinner is disrupted when the Commissaire\'s son Gigi is kidnapped and held for ransom by criminals  led by a failed musician called The Chauffeur.The kidnappers represent the warring criminal syndicates of Ennui-sur-Blas??  and demand the release of an underworld accountant called  The Abacus   who possesses their shared financial records.  The Abacus  is being held in a solitary confinement cell at police headquarters. Wright recollects his own imprisonment in that same cell for his homosexuality  for which he was bailed out by Howitzer and offered a job at the Dispatch.Following a shoot-out at the kidnapper\'s hideout  Gigi manages to sneak out a message in Morse code to  send the cook . Lt. Nescaffier is sent into the kidnappers\' hideout  ostensibly to provide both them and Gigi with food  but secretly the food is laced with poison. The criminals all succumb to the poison  and Nescaffier just barely survives (due to his strong stomach) after being made to test it first  but The Chauffeur escapes with Gigi  and leads the police on a chase. Gigi manages to escape out of the sunroof and reunites with his father. During his recovery  Nescaffier saves  The Abacus  from starving to death by preparing him an omelette  the prisoner having been totally forgotten in the commotion.Back at the Dispatch office  Howitzer tells Wright to reinsert a deleted segment. In it  a recovering Nescaffier tells Wright that the taste of the poison was unlike anything he had ever eaten before  before they commiserate over the state of being foreigners in France. Howitzer and Wright disagree on whether this conversation is important.In an epilogue  the French Dispatch editorial staff mourn Howitzer\'s death and start to write his obituary for the final issue.' ,nan

The woman is hanged from a tree and ultimately set on fire. Before she dies  however  her spirit is bound to the body of a doll.Many years later  disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things strange and unusual. His latest assignment takes him to Boston  where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. As he\'s preparing to leave  he discovers the doll and purposely crushes it  accidentally freeing Mary\'s spirit. Gerry later gets into an accident as he\'s driving away after seeing a young girl  Alice Pagett  run across the road. He follows her to the tree from the prologue  the site where he found the doll  and hears her speak before collapsing. When he takes her to a nearby church  he learns that Alice is deaf and couldn\'t have spoken. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story rather than a hoax or prank.The following day Alice stuns the community by speaking  proclaiming that she has been cured by the Virgin Mary. This launches a media furor that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During the healings  a statue of the Virgin Mary near the chancel of the church cries tears of blood. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims  assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice  learning that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary  the girl has only assumed that Mary was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of  Mary  as a horrific entity  Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan  Alice\'s maternal uncle  who was healed by Alice  but also suspects the healings\' true nature. Fr. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor  a witch who performed miracles for Satan  but before he has the chance to warn anybody he is attacked by Mary and his body is found hanging in the church. Bishop Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences. His death is declared an accident.Gerry befriends Natalie Gates  the town\'s physician  and reveals that he was found fabricating stories which is why he now reports hoax stories  hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair eventually comes across the information Fr. Hagan discovered  revealing Mary sold her soul to Satan in order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom is revealed to be Alice) to perform  miracles  prompting people to pledge themselves to her  and in turn  Satan. Mary tries to kill Gerry  but Msgr. Delgarde drives her away with prayer and his crucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Bishop Gyles was aware of the history in Banfield involving Elnor  but thought that it was not connected to the miracles that were recently occurring. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry\'s tarnished reputation.Alice  who they believe is unaware of Mary\'s true nature  wishes to hold a church service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Msgr. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Mary Elnor would make her stronger and condemn their soul to Hell. Msgr. Delgarde  along with Gerry and Natalie  tries to perform a ritual in the church to stop this  but Mary appears and crushes him with a burning cross.Once the service begins  Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary Elnor three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes  that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language  urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice  entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary\'s true nature  Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree suddenly bursts into flames  causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it. She incinerates Bishop Gyles before trying to kill Gerry  but Alice sacrifices herself to save his life. This in turn causes Mary to disappear  as Alice was her link to the living world. Struck by her sacrifice  Gerry begs God to save Alice\'s life. She comes back to life  but is once again deaf. All the people whom Alice cured soon return to their prior state and the film concludes with a warning from Biblical verse Matthew 7:15.\n(copied from Wikipedia)' , 'Be careful who you pray to.'

Then an old pickup truck comes hauling out of the mine shaft and down a desolate rural road. The driver is a bearded elderly man (Oliver Cooper) obscured in the darkness of his truck\'s cabin. He looks down at the passenger seat and touches a ghost trap that\'s holding a spirit. His truck is being chased by an unseen creature that is eventually able to sideswipe the vehicle and send it crashing into a cornfield. The man stumbles out into an open field in front of an old farm house. He gets to the porch and turns around and holds up the trap baiting the unseen spirit in the corn field. The old man is Egon Spengler and he readies a foot pedal switch as invisible steps are seen advancing in the dirt across the field. When it is in position  Egon stomps the pedal and several electric towers begin to activate. But they short out before powering on the device they were intended for and Egon quickly goes inside and shuts the door. He hides the trap in a compartment under the wood floor and then sits in a chair with his PKE meter. As fog fills the room  his PKE begins to light up and it\'s arms extend reminiscent of when a ghost is present. Egon is attacked in his chair and the PKE meter falls to the floor and turns off. A spirit orb is seen leaving the house from outside. Back in the house  the PKE meter activates again eluding to a new ghost nearby.We meet Callie (Carrie Coon) and her kids Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) as they are getting evicted from their apartment. Callie gets notice that her father has passed away in his farmhouse in Oklahoma and takes the kids with her to collect anything of value including the home. They find a dilapidated house full of clutter. As they\'re looking around  Janine (the Ghostbusters\' receptionist) walks in and tells them that Callie\'s dad (Egon) had a lot of debt and a valueless farm. The ground begins to shake in what appears to be tremors from an earthquake  and the family huddle under a table. Phoebe spots the PKE meter under the chair her grandfather was in when he died.Callie takes Trevor and Phoebe into town to eat after she admits to them that they will be staying there for a while until she can figure out what to do. They find that it\'s a very small southern town where everyone knew of the mysterious man they all called  the dirt farmer  since there was no evidence he ever grew any crops. Trevor applies to work at the burger joint because he is smitten with the girl who works there named Lucky (Celeste O\'Connor).In the following days Phoebe begins exploring the farm while using the PKE meter. She notices a chess board with an initial move made so she makes a move from her side of the board. Callie starts Phoebe in summer school and meets her teacher Gary (Paul Rudd) as she drops her off. Gary is just there to collect a paycheck and has the kids watch VHS\'s of old horror movies (the first one being Cujo (1983)) while he sits in the back doing research on the ongoing tremors in the area. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge on Seismology and he explains to her that the tremor wave patterns don\'t match up with typical earthquakes from history. Phoebe also meets a boy in her class who calls himself  Podcast  (Logan Kim) since he\'s always recording for his show with his microphone.Back at the farmhouse  Phoebe sees that another move is made on the chess board and begins playing the ghost as the chess pieces begin moving in front of her. The ghost leads her downstairs by turning on lights until she finds the ghost trap under a floor panel. She takes it to Gary where he explains what it is based on his knowledge of the famed New York siege from 1984. He shows her and Podcast old footage of the Ghostbusters commercial on YouTube. They rig the trap to a school bus battery to get it to open. They succeed and a ghost resembling one of the demon dogs from the original flies away.Revelations come to fruition as Trevor finds Ecto-1 in the barn under a tarp and Phoebe finds Egon\'s lab in the basement. They both realize that their grandfather was a Ghostbuster and begin to take matters into their own hands. Phoebe repairs a proton blaster with help from Egon\'s invisible ghost and takes it out for a test with Podcast tagging along. Upon firing it  they hear a rustling in a nearby warehouse. They find the metal eating ghost named Muncher. They attempt to wrangle and capture him but fail. Meanwhile  Trevor repairs Ecto-1 and takes it for a joy ride where he comes upon Phoebe and Podcast who tell him what they were doing. The trio take off to capture Muncher in Ecto-1. They chase him thru the city and destroy tons of property with the proton gun. They succeed in capturing it with Egon\'s RC car mounted ghost trap. All the chaos alerted the police and they are subsequently pulled over and put in the town\'s holding cell. During their time at the jailhouse  Phoebe uses her  one phone call  option to call the number of the Ghostbusters from the commercial. Ray Stantz answers and explains that the team broke up after they had ostensibly eliminated all the ghosts. He and Egon had a falling out after Egon stole all their equipment claiming Gozer could still bring the end of the world. Phoebe tells him that Egon was killed a week ago before she is abruptly cut off by the sheriff claiming her phone time is up. Callie and Gary -who were out on a date during all of this- show up and bail them out.Phoebe confronts her mom for not telling her who their grandfather really was. Callie counters with the history she had with her dad. She wasn\'t into science like he was and felt like they never bonded and he didn\'t care about her. That\'s why he left them and became a recluse on the Oklahoma farm she concluded.The kids -feeling there\'s got to be a reason their grandfather would sacrifice everything to live on a farm in the middle of nowhere- find in his lab that his  dirt farm  was actually a field of hundreds of ghost traps meant to capture Gozer. They realize that his trap must have failed and set off to investigate the mine shaft once more. By this time Lucky has become close with Trevor thru work and the discovery that she is the sheriff\'s daughter. So she tags along to the mine with Trevor  Phoebe  and Podcast. They discover the root of all the tremors is the fact that the mine is actually a portal to the evil dead and every time Gozer attempts to raise the hoard of ghosts -along with the twin demon dogs- a series of 4 seismic activated proton guns that Egon rigged up inside turn on. They automatically cross beams and suppress the constant attempts of the ghosts trying to escape. This was the source of the recurrent tremors everyone in town was experiencing and holding Gozer back was the insurmountable task Egon had taken on alone since no one else believes him.That same night  Gary goes to Walmart to pick up some ice cream after his unusual date with Callie. He discovers several mini StayPuft marshmallow men roaming the store causing chaos like a bunch of gremlins. He comes upon the demon dog he released earlier and gets chased out to his car and attacked just like the scene from Cujo. Back at the farmhouse  Callie finds the hidden lab and discovers that her father Egon had a memory board of all her life on the wall. Just as she realizes that he truly cared about her  the other demon dog finds her in the lab and possesses her.The kids come home to reveal their discovery to Callie but find her possessed  before she jumps out the window and runs off towards the mine shaft. She finds Gary  who has already allowed the ghosts to start escaping by damaging the auto-proton guns that were keeping them at bay. The two  merge energies  in the mine. The kids retrieve Ecto-1 from the police impound with Lucky\'s help. Phoebe and Podcast are able to get the RC ghost trap and proton blaster out from the weapon holding cell by reaching in and releasing Muncher who immediately eats away the bars and escapes.They arrive at the mine and witness Callie and Gary transforming into the demon dog forms with Gozer sitting between them. Phoebe steps out from hiding to talk to and distract Gozer while Podcast controls the RC trap and captures the demon dog possessing Callie. This releases her from dog form as she passes out. The kids escape in Ecto-1 with Callie as the Gary -still possessed in dog form- chases after them.They make their way to the farmhouse and attempt the same trap as Egon. Callie and Phoebe stand on the porch holding the ghost trap with the demon dog that Gozer needs to become fully resurrected. Gozer appears out of the corn field and Phoebe tries to turn on the traps but they fail again just as they had the first time with Egon. Some mini StayPuft marshmallow men sabotage the equipment inside Ecto-1  which allows Gozer to release the demon dog from the ghost trap. The freed dog possesses Lucky. Just as Gozer  now back to full strength  is about to kill Phoebe  she is hit with a proton blast from behind. It\'s Ray Stantz who had just arrived with Peter Venkman and Winston Zeddemore! The three original Ghostbusters cross the beams and fire at Gozer. She appears subdued but then begins uncrossing the beams and blasts the Ghostbusters back causing them all to fall down. Gozer approaches them as Peter jokingly complains about the inherent troubles in their relationship. Just as she reaches them she is again captured by a sole proton beam. This time it\'s Phoebe  whose aim is being guided by the ghost of Egon. This is the first time his image is revealed to the audience.The other three Ghostbusters jump up and join the battle by firing their beams as well. With the combined force of four beams once again  Gozer is suppressed but not captured. Meanwhile  Trevor and Podcast have been able to defeat the mini-Pufts and repair the sabotaged equipment  allowing Trevor to emerge from Ecto-1 and fire his proton beam at the electrical capacitors. The burst of energy charges them up. Callie throws the switch to try to turn the traps on again  and this time they successfully activate  capturing Gozer and the demon dogs.The other three original Ghostbusters stare in amazement at the sight of the ghost form of their fallen comrade. They watch as he says goodbye  fixes Phoebe\'s glasses -identical to his- and gives Callie a hug. Having reconciled with his family  Egon\'s form fades and dissipates into the night sky. Lucky and Gary break free of the frozen dog carcasses  and the three surviving original Ghostbusters become acquainted with the Spenglers  before Winston tells them that he will fix up Ecto-1  and the three original Ghostbusters take it and their equipment back to New York City. We see an overhead shot of Ecto-1 driving with emergency lights on across a bridge in New York City as the theme song  Ghostbusters  begins.There is a mid-credits scene where Dana Barrett Venkman (Sigourney Weaver) tests Peter Venkman\'s psychic powers with the same patterned cards and electro-shock machine Peter had used in his University research before he became a Ghostbuster  and a post-credits scene shows a brief conversation between Winston  who is now the wealthy head of his family  and Janine  in which Winston mentions that he has been using his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters\' properties  including Ray\'s Occult Bookstore and the fire station that had originally served as the Ghostbusters\' headquarters. This is followed by Winston opening the fire station\'s door to allow Ecto-1 to be driven back inside  after which we see a shot of the basement\'s containment system with a blinking red light.' , 'Discover the Past.

This sets off a chain reaction of events  told in four parts.A Dark Spirit\nFive months after the robbery  Patrick Hill (Jason Statham) joins Fortico Security as an armored truck guard. His manager Terry (Eddie Marsan) commends his references  and company trainer Haiden  Bullet  Blaire (Holt McCallany) nicknames him  H . Hill barely passes his training  and gets off to a rocky start with his colleagues  including  Boy Sweat  Dave (Josh Hartnett)  Sticky John (Alex Ferns)  Shirley (Tadhg Murphy)  Stuart (Alessandro Babalola)   Hollow  Bob Martin (Rocci Williams) and Dana Curtis (Niamh Algar). H has replaced Sticky John in his job  who has been relegated to a desk job. Sticky John tries to get to know H  but H is not the social type. H is assigned to a daily detail with Bullet and Dave.\nDuring a drop-off of $2.5 million in cash  Bullet is taken hostage. Hill convinces a panicked Dave to comply with the robbers\' demands  before disposing of the entire crew with expert marksmanship and merciless efficiency. Before killing them  H wants to know whom the robbers work for.Questioned by FBI agents investigating the robbery (they are same guys who are investigating the robbery from 5 months ago. H denies there is any connection between the 2 robberies)  Hill is assigned to desk duty as a precaution  but Fortico\'s CEO Blake Halls (Rob Delaney) returns him to working in the field.\nThe investigators Hubbard (Josh Cowdery) & Okey (Jason Wong) identify him to their superior  Agent King (Andy Garc??a)  as someone the FBI has been hunting for 25 years  but King tells them to leave Hill alone. An associate Kirsty (Lyne Ren??e) delivers Hill a dossier of Fortico employee files  photos of Dana\'s family  and an autopsy report.Three months later  Hill and Bullet are waylaid in Chinatown  but the robbers flee at the sight of Hill. Bullet and Dave share their suspicions about Hill with each other. Dana takes H out for a date  and H questions Dana at gunpoint about her stash of $125 000. She claims to have stolen the cash from a liquor store pickup  and Hill shows her photos of her parents  threatening them if she is withholding information.Scorched Earth\nFive months before joining Fortico  on the day of the first robbery  Hill is with his son Dougie (Eli Brown). Revealed to be working with his own robbery crew  Hill grudgingly agrees to monitor the armored truck\'s route  leaving Dougie in the car. But turns out that there were 2 teams of robbers after the truck. The 2nd team of robbers hijack the truck much before Hill\'s team  and spot Dougie nearby in Hill\'s car (which was parked right next to the spot where the truck was stopped). Racing back to his son  Hill watches as Dougie is executed  and is shot himself and left for dead. Three weeks later  Hill wakes up in the hospital. Blaming him for Dougie\'s death  his wife Jane (Eve Macklin) leaves him. He meets with King  who gives him a list of possible suspects and agrees to temporarily turn a blind eye.Hill is actually Mason Hargreaves  a notorious crime lord; determined to find Dougie\'s killer  Hargreaves and his men - led by Mike (Darrell D\'Silva)  Brendan (Cameron Jack)  and Moggy (Babs Olusanmokun) - kill nearly everyone on King\'s list  without results. They even find a crime family with $2.5 M stashed in the house  but Mike and Moggy reckon its not the team they are looking for.\nMike voices his concerns about retaliation (& suggests that it was perhaps an inside job with Fortico)  and Hargreaves agrees to lay low in London  but instead assumes the identity of Patrick Hill and joins Fortico to continue the hunt himself. It was Hargreaves\' own crew who attempted the Chinatown robbery  until Mike recognized him.Bad Animals  Bad\nSometime before the first robbery  a group of disgruntled veterans - Carlos (Laz Alonso)  Sam (Ra??l Castillo)  Brad (DeObia Oparei)  Tom (Chris Reilly)  Jan (Scott Eastwood)  and their former sergeant  Jackson (Jeffrey Donovan) - decide to become thieves. They rob Carlos\'s wealthy client (Carlos was working as a security guard after his discharge from the military)  resulting in only a few hundred thousand dollars. With help from an unidentified guard (working inside Fortico) who served under Jackson  they pull off a more ambitious heist ($6 M) of an armored truck. Turns out Jackson\'s crew and Hargreaves crew went after the same truck and events of the first robbery ensued; unaware of Hargreaves\' identity  Jan needlessly shoots the guards  Dougie  and Hargreaves  who sees Jan\'s face.Liver  Lungs  Spleen & Heart\nFive months later  the veterans reunite to steal over $150 million from the Fortico depot on Black Friday weekend. Bullet reveals to Hargreaves that he is Jackson\'s inside man (and he admits to playing his part in the first robbery)  threatening him into cooperating. Jackson\'s crew boards H\'s and Bullet\'s truck  while Bullet had disabled the cameras. Bullet needed H to get the crew inside the depot. The crew takes the depot hostage  but an alarm is triggered; in the ensuing gunfight  Bullet kills Dana and Dave  and Hargreaves kills several of the robbers. Fleeing with Bullet and Jackson  Jan kills them to escape alone with the money.Jan finds a phone in one of the money bags  planted by Hargreaves to track its location. Hargreaves confronts him with Dougie\'s autopsy report  shooting him in the same places he shot Dougie. Abandoning the money  Hargreaves tells King his task is done  and is driven away.' , 'A one man army.'

Madeleine shoots Safin  but he survives. She flees onto a nearby frozen lake and falls through the ice  but he rescues her.In the present  after the capture of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) (Bond\'s arch-enemy and foster brother. He is the founder and head of the criminal syndicate Spectre and is now in MI6 custody)  Madeleine is in Matera with James Bond (Daniel Craig). Spectre assassins ambush Bond when he visits Vesper Lynd\'s tomb. Though Bond and Madeleine escape the assassins (one of the assassins tells him that Madeleine is the daughter of Spectre) (Madeleine also gets a call from Blofeld commending her on her sacrifice  while she was in the care with Bond  trying to escape)  he believes she has betrayed him  and forces her to board a train out of Matera  ending their relationship.Five years later  the MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik) is kidnapped by Spectre (he got a call from Safin just before his kidnapping and told him to transfer the research files into a pen drive). The Spectre team is led by the same assassin Primo (Dali Benssalah) who attacked Bond. He makes Valdo steal a vial before kidnapping him.\nWith M\'s (Ralph Fiennes) approval  Obruchev had developed Project Heracles  a bio-weapon containing nanobots that infect like a virus upon touch and are coded to an individual\'s DNA  rendering it lethal to the target and their relatives but harmless to others. Bond has retired to Jamaica  where he is contacted by Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and his CIA colleague Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen)  who ask for Bond\'s help finding Obruchev. They say Obruchev is in Cuba  and that Spectre is gathering there  which cannot be a coincidence.\nBond initially declines  but after Nomi (Lashana Lynch) (A new  00  agent who entered active service some time after Bond\'s retirement and was assigned the 007 number)  an MI6 agent and his successor as 007  tells him about Project Heracles. Bond is furious at M for some reason for keeping Obruchev on MI6 payroll and agrees to help Felix.\nTurns out M had sanctioned the development of Heracles off the MI6 books. Not even the British PM knew about its existence.Bond goes to Cuba and meets Paloma (Ana De Armas)  a CIA agent working with Leiter. They infiltrate a Spectre meeting to retrieve Obruchev. Still imprisoned in Belmarsh  Blofeld uses a disembodied  bionic eye  to view the meeting and release a nanobot mist to kill Bond  but it kills all the Spectre members instead  as Obruchev had reprogrammed the nanobots to infect them on Safin\'s orders. Bond captures Obruchev and rendezvouses with Leiter and Ash  who is discovered as a double agent working for Safin. Ash kills Leiter and escapes with Obruchev.Bond returns to MI6 HQ and meets M. Bond wants a meeting with Blofeld. Bond insults M  who flatly refuses to arrange a meeting with Blofeld.\nEve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) (M\'s secretary and Bond\'s ally) and Q (Ben Whishaw) (MI6\'s Quartermaster who outfits  00  agents with equipment for use in the field) arrange a meeting between Bond and Blofeld to find Obruchev. Q looks at the USB Bond recovered from Obruchev and tells Bond that the files are a database of DNA info of millions of people from around the world. Using this database  and the weapon  the holder of the weapon can eliminate their targets with precision. But Obruchev modified the coding to eliminate anyone related to the target  so entire families are wiped out. it is now a weapon of mass destruction.Safin coerces Madeleine (he approaches her as her new psychotherapist patient and reveals that he was the man who saved her from drowning in the ice all those yrs ago) to infect herself with a nanobot dose to kill Blofeld  with whom she has been in contact since his imprisonment (Blofeld has been pretending to be mad  and Madeleine was appointed as his doctor). Safin indicates that he knows about MAdeleine\'s daughter and threatens her  to get Madeleine to do his bidding\nBond is furious to learn that Blofeld has access to Madeleine.\nWhen Bond encounters Madeleine at Blofeld\'s prison cell  he touches her and unknowingly infects himself with nanobots before she leaves. Blofeld tells Bond that he staged the ambush at Vesper\'s tomb to make it appear as if Madeleine had betrayed him  continuing his vendetta against his former foster brother. Enraged  Bond attacks Blofeld  unintentionally allowing the nanobots to infect and kill him.Bond tracks Madeleine to her childhood home in Norway and learns she has a five-year-old daughter  Mathilde (Lisa-Dorah Sonnet)  whom Madeleine claims is not his. Madeleine tells him that her father murdered Safin\'s family on Blofeld\'s orders. She tells Bond that Safin\'s family owned an island  that was taken over by Spectre and now Safin has it back. Q determines that the Island is in disputed waters between Japan and Russia and has a chemical plant dating back to WW II.\nHaving avenged his family by killing Blofeld and destroying Spectre  Safin and his entourage are in pursuit of Bond  Madeleine and Mathilde. Though Bond defeats the thugs and kills Ash  Safin captures Madeleine and Mathilde.Q enables Bond and Nomi to infiltrate Safin\'s headquarters on an island missile base  converted to a nanobot factory  where Obruchev is mass-producing the Heracles technology for Safin to kill millions of people. Madeleine is separated from Mathilde. Bond and Nomi put explosives all around Obruchev\'s lab  when Bond is threatened by Safin to surrender  else he will hurt Mathilde. Bond has no option but to surrender and literally bow before Safin  for the sake of Mathilde  whom he knows is his daughter. But Bond launches a counter attack  when Safin is distracted and forces Safin to retreat with Mathilde.\nDuring the ensuing gunfight  Nomi kills Obruchev by pushing him into a nanobot vat. Madeleine escapes from captivity  while Safin releases Mathilde to die in the explosions about to set off by Bond and Nomi. Madeleine finds Mathilde purely by chance..\nNomi takes Madeleine and Mathilde away from the island to safety; Bond stays to open the island\'s blast-resistant silo doors. He calls in a missile strike from HMS Dragon to destroy the factory  then kills Safin\'s men.Safin ambushes and wounds Bond by shooting him. He fights Bond infecting him with a vial containing nanobots programmed to kill Madeleine and Mathilde. Bond kills Safin and opens the silos. Bond contacts Madeleine by radio to say goodbye and tell her he loves her. Madeleine confirms that Mathilde is his daughter. Missiles hit the island  destroying the factory and killing Bond.\nAt MI6  M  Moneypenny  Nomi  Q and Bill Tanner (Rory Kinnear) (M\'s chief of staff) drink to Bond\'s memory.

At a party  Patrizia meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver)  a law student and heir to a 50% interest in the Gucci fashion house through his father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons). Patrizia aggressively pursues the awkward Maurizio (she forces him to ask her out on a date)  charming him into love. Rodolfo (who had a spy following Maurizio at all times) warns Maurizio that Patrizia is only after wealth and tells Maurizio that he will disinherit him if he marries Patrizia; Maurizio chooses Patrizia over his connection to Gucci  leaving the family.Patrizia and Maurizio marry  and Maurizio takes a job at the Reggiani trucking company. When Patrizia becomes pregnant  she sees her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation. She lets it slip to Maurizio\'s uncle Aldo (Al Pacino) that she is pregnant; Aldo is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing (he teaches Patrizia everything about the fashion business  including the cattle farms that generate the leather to the retail shops with the glamorous models). Aldo lives in New York but comes to Italy to host his birthday party. Patrizia and Maurizio attend  but Rodolfo backs out. Aldo asks Patrizia and Maurizio to visit him in New York. Patrizia sees how via NYC  Aldo is servicing a Japanese clientele. Aldo wants Maurizio to start playing a more active role with Gucci in his legal capacity (as a lawyer)Aldo introduces Patrizia to his unintelligent son Paolo (Jared Leto) (& his wife Jenny Gucci (Florence Andrews))  who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. When Aldo starts spending time with Maurizio  Paolo takes his designs to Rodolfo for sponsorship  and it told that he is totally incompetent and sends him away.\nThanks to Aldo  Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter\'s death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will but fails to sign a document transferring the Gucci shares to him before he dies. Patrizia forges Rodolfo\'s signature  giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci.Patrizia starts to devise a plot to obtain a controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo\'s shares (the two hold the other 50% interest). Patrizia finds that her maid has a Gucci bag and investigates to find a whole market of fake Gucci products. Turns out Aldo knew about this  and was the source of the fake merchandise  as he wanted Gucci to be an household brand  and not an inspirational one.She clashes with Aldo over the firm\'s clandestine sale of cheap  fake  Gucci products on the black market and begins to consult Giuseppina  Pina  (Salma Hayek)  a psychic whose ad she saw on TV  for guidance. She manipulates Maurizio  who has little real interest in Gucci  into taking a more active role within the company. She convinces Maurizio that Aldo has to go as he has become an embarrassment to the brand.Paolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives the proof to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line under the Gucci name and distribute it. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. Patrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark; the police stop his fashion show by force. Patrizia and Maurizio ask Paolo to sell them his shares  but he rebuffs them and cuts ties between them.Italian police ransack Maurizio\'s house and attempt to arrest Maurizio for forging Rodolfo\'s signature. Maurizio\'s family flee to Switzerland  where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi (Camille Cottin). After an argument between Maurizio and Patrizia  Maurizio decides that he is tired of his wife\'s influence on himself and the company. He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola  which Pina seemingly senses.\nWhen Maurizio\'s business plans harm the company  he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp  through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out  he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal\'s instigator. Dejected  Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio.Patrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio  but he flatly ignores her. Later  he asks Patrizia for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole (Jack Huston)  which Patrizia refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming Texan designer Tom Ford (Reeve Carney) to revitalize the company\'s image through a new line. Ford\'s products are successful  but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company (Revenues are dropping  company has debt  profits are elusive. Plus  Maurizio has bought many expensive items and billed it to the company as expense) that  by 1995  Investcorp\'s leaders feel compelled to buy him out for 150 MM dollars  replacing him with Ford and De Sole. Patrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her kill him. Pina puts Patrizia in contact with two hit-men. A few days later  the hit-men shoot Maurizio to death in broad daylight outside his office.Closing intertitles describe the fate of the remaining characters: Aldo died of prostate cancer in 1990 and Paolo died in poverty shortly following the sale of their shares to Maurizio. Patrizia (29 years)  Pina (25 years)  and the hit-men (26 years) are sentenced prolong prison terms following their arrest for murder. Gucci is fully acquired by Investcorp and successfully managed into the present (net worth of $60 Bn); no Gucci family members remain at the company.' , 'A legacy worth killing for.'

One of the boys  Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman)  sees the photographer\'s assistant  Alana Kane (Alana Haim)  and becomes smitten with her. He tries to talk to her  though she seems disinterested due to the fact that she is 25 and he is 15. Gary tells Alana that he is an actor  and he eventually succeeds in getting her to agree to hang out with him  but not as a date.Gary and Alana meet at a restaurant that he frequents since he appears to know the manager. The two discuss their jobs  and Gary mentions that he also works with his mother at a public relations company. Gary assures Alana that they are not going to forget each other. They walk home  and we see Alana lives with her parents and two sisters (all played by Haim\'s real family)  while Gary lives with his brother Greg (Milo Herschlag).Gary works with his mom  Momma Anita (Mary Elizabeth Ellis)  and they meet with a restaurant owner  Jerry Frick (John Michael Higgins)  and his wife Mioko (Yumi Mizui)  over a new Japanese restaurant they are trying to open. Jerry speaks with a accent racist accent to his wife. Later on  Anita tells Gary that she can\'t accompany him for a trip to New York where he will be featured on auditions and a variety show.Alana accompanies Gary to New York  where he rejoins his movie partners from the film  Under One Roof   where he starred as one of many siblings along with renowned actress Lucille Dolittle (Christine Ebersole). During the show  Gary hits Lucille over the head with a pillow  and when being interviewed  he makes a joke about  doing three beavers . Lucille later angrily chastises him and hits him. Afterward  Gary meets with an agent  Gale (Maya Rudolph)  and does a commercial for a vest. While this happens  Alana befriends another actor named Lance (Skyler Gisondo).Upon returning to California  Alana begins a relationship with Lance. However  when she brings him over for dinner with her family  he declines to say a prayer because  despite being raised in the Jewish faith  he identifies as an atheist. Alana breaks things off with him shortly afterward.Gary soon gets into the waterbed business and gets his friends Kirk (Will Arangola) and Mark (Griff Giacchino)  along with Alana  now that they are becoming friends  although Gary is still in love with her. They go to an expo called Soggy Bottom  where there are other booths like one for  The Munsters   with Fred Gwynne (John C. Reilly) in attendance. As Gary tries to sell the water beds  cops come to aggressively arrest him on suspicion of murder. Alana runs all the way to the police station  where Gary is soon let go when their first suspect says he doesn\'t know Gary. He leaves the station and hugs Alana.Alana operates the phones at the waterbed business  with Gary telling her to sound  sexier   but he feels she overdoes it. He later accompanies her to meet an agent  Mary Grady (Harriet Sansom Harris). When she asks Alana if she would do nudity in films  she initially says yes  but Gary urges her to say no. The two argue on the way home because Gary isn\'t comfortable with audiences seeing Alana nude when he can\'t. She later relents and shows him her breasts but slaps him when he asks to touch them.Alana joins Gary at an event to sell waterbeds  where Gary meets a girl from school named Sue Pomerantz (Isabelle Kusman). The two chat and go off to hook up  which Alana sees and appears jealous for it. She randomly kisses another guy out of spite and then walks home in nothing but her underwear (as she was modeling that way).Later on  Alana goes to an audition for a part alongside actor Jack Holden (Sean Penn). He takes a liking to her and compares her to Grace Kelly. Jack takes Alana to a bar   The Tail o\' the Cock   where Gary and his friends also make an appearance. Jack runs into his old friend  director Rex Blau (Tom Waits)  and they convince everyone in attendance to watch Jack recreate a motorcycle stunt from his film  The Bridges of Toko-San   which he did with Kelly. Alana sits on the back of the motorcycle  but as soon as Jack takes off  Alana falls backwards. Gary runs all the way to Alana to make sure she is okay while everyone else cheers for Jack. He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis  which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds  since they are made from vinyl  and vinyl is made from oil. The two  plus Greg  Kirk  and Mark  later deliver a waterbed to the home of producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper)  who is something of a lunatic. He grills Gary for the pronunciation of his girlfriend\'s name (being Barbra Streisand)  and explicitly threatens to kill Gary\'s whole family if he messes anything up during the setup. Gary and Alana set up the water bed  but accidentally pull the hose out and get the carpet wet. They get the other three boys out of there quickly.On their way out  they run into Jon coming up a hill  where he forces them to take him to the gas station to fill up since his car broke down. They leave him there when they see Jon threatening to light a man on fire by spraying him with the gas nozzle while holding a lighter. They drive back towards Jon\'s car  where Gary starts to smash the windshield. Unfortunately  their truck runs out of gas  and they have to roll the truck carefully down the hills backwards until it eventually stops in the middle of the street somewhere. Gary and the boys go off to get gas  while Alana sits on the street. Jon walks nearby and throws a garbage bin through a store window  but she manages to avoid being seen by him before he tries to hit on two tennis players.With the waterbed business failing from the gas crisis  Gary and Alana look to move onto other work. Gary invests in a pinball arcade while Alana decides to do volunteer work for mayoral candidate Councilman Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). Gary and Alana have an argument  leading to them parting ways.While Alana is taking calls at the campaign office  she notices a creepy guy (Jon Beavers) scoping the office out. She confronts him but he gives her vague responses as to why he is there. Alana is later invited to drinks with Wachs  where the creepy guy is sitting nearby again. She meets Wachs\' partner Matthew (Joseph Cross)  and Alana learns that Wachs is gay and that the creep is most likely a spy trying to dig up dirt on Wachs and his campaign. Wachs asks Alana to go home with Matthew and pretend that she is his girlfriend. When they get home  Matthew breaks down in tears  asking Alana if she has a boyfriend. She says  yes and no   but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade  dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana\'s friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there. Similarly  Alana goes to the restaurant where she first went out with Gary  but he isn\'t there. They eventually keep going until they literally run into each other in front of the movie theater.

(Forest Whitaker)  her brother Cecil (Leroy McClain)  and her sisters Erma (Saycon Sengbloh) and Carolyn (Hailey Kilgore) in Detroit  Michigan. C.L.  pastor of the largest Baptist church in Detroit  frequently entertained large parties of friends and acquaintances at home. CL is divorced from his wife Barbara.\nThe predatory actions of an adult friend of the family  coinciding with the sudden death of her mother  Barbara (Audra McDonald)  traumatizes Aretha. She ceases to speak for weeks  until her father demands that she sing in front of their congregation at church. She does not reveal that she was assaulted  nor does she reveal the name of the man who caused her to become pregnant.Seven years later  Aretha  now a teen mother of two boys. she is touring with CL  supporting Martin Luther King  in mobilizing support for his movement  by singing songs. She meets Ted White (Marlon Wayans)  a local producer  at a party at her father\'s house. The two strike up a conversation before being interrupted by C. L.  who warns Ted to stay away from his family. Later  C. L. surprises Aretha with tickets to New York for a meeting with Columbia Records executive John Hammond (Tate Donovan). After being offered a contract  Aretha begins to sing jazz records with Columbia  including  Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive. Four albums later  Aretha still lacks a signature hit as a jazz singer. In a club one evening  she announces she will be singing a tribute to inspiration and longtime family friend Dinah Washington (Mary J. Blige)  who is in the audience; as Aretha begins to sing one of Dinah\'s songs  Dinah becomes outraged and makes a scene. Later  Dinah advises Aretha to find songs that move her  and stop trying to fit the polished image her father wants her to project. Aretha has had 4 albums so far  but no hits.Aretha connects again with Ted  with whom she begins a relationship. Frustrated by her lack of success after nine albums  Aretha begins skipping recording sessions to see him  embarrassing her father. Much to the chagrin of her sisters and the dismay of their father  Aretha returns home to introduce Ted to her family. After Ted and her father have a verbal disagreement  Aretha announces her plans to have Ted become her manager; her father begrudgingly consents. But he vows never to manager her career again.Two years later in 1966  Ted and Aretha marry and have a child. Aretha is dropped by Columbia (as she has gone 9 albums without a hit). Ted secures a deal with veteran record producer Jerry Wexler (Marc Maron) of Atlantic Records  who pairs her with accomplished musicians in Muscle Shoals  where Aretha begins to record her first hit   I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You) . However  the recording session is cut short after Ted gets into a fight with the manager of the studio. The studio is made up of all white musicians and Ted believes that they are insulting to niggers and are hitting on Aretha.\nAfter an altercation with Ted results in a black eye  Aretha returns home to Detroit. With her family  she hears her own song recorded in Muscle Shoals on the radio  empowering her to take a more hands-on role in her career. She places a call to Jerry Wexler  telling him she is ready to work. One night  Aretha and Carolyn are inspired to re-arrange Otis Redding\'s song  Respect   which becomes a #1 single. Aretha enters her golden years in 1968. She owns the category of soul music.Before a concert  Dr. Martin Luther King (Gilbert Glenn Brown)  a longtime family friend of the Franklins  honors Aretha with an award from the Southern Christian Leadership Center for Aretha\'s unwavering support of the Movement and proclaims February 16 as  Aretha Franklin Day  in Detroit. Aretha sings another signature hit   (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.  She makes plans to sing for another civil rights event one weekend in Memphis  which Ted forbids her to do  as he had arranged for her to meet with Wexler and other executives to discuss the prospect of a tour In Europe to whip up appetite for her upcoming album. Aretha openly defies Ted  and he assaults her in a hotel elevator. Jerry promises her a payday of $250k from the tour. But Ted is hostile  as he wants Arethe to consider TV and movie deals in the US  that don\'t pay nearly as much.\nThe tour goes ahead. Ted is nothing but an obstacle as he objects to every little thing on tour. In Europe  Time magazine publishes an article depicting Ted\'s abuse towards Aretha  witnessed by guests and staff in the hotel lobby  an angry Ted confronts Aretha  causing her to end their relationship.After the breakdown of her marriage to Ted  Aretha begins dating her tour manager Ken Cunningham (Albert Jones)  and eventually has her fourth child. Another seven years later  after learning of Dr. King\'s assassination  Aretha\'s distraught father drunkenly argues with her over the direction of the Movement  expressing doubt in the younger generation\'s patience and ability to make long-term gains. Aretha expresses her full support of the Movement  and C.L.  further angered  tells Aretha that she no longer walks in the spirit.Aretha continues to release hits but overworks herself to the point of burnout: she double-books and cancels appearances  and copes with the pressure of her profession by increasingly turning to alcohol and drugs. Aretha\'s siblings attempt to stage an intervention  but Aretha suspects they are jealous  and angrily tells them they are supported by her success. During another overseas performance  a drunken Aretha falls from the stage  and Ken tells her he can\'t be with her anymore. Aretha continues to tailspin downward  finally hitting bottom during a drinking binge at home. She sees a vision of her late mother  who consoles her  and she finds the strength to quit drinking  leading to Ken reconciling with her.Aretha becomes convinced that she must return to her gospel roots  and approaches Wexler with the idea of creating a gospel album  which she wishes to produce herself. Doubtful of the album\'s ability to sell  Wexler attempts to dissuade her before relenting on the condition that she allow the recording of the album to be filmed for a documentary.Aretha begins rehearsals for her gospel album with family friend James Cleveland (Tituss Burgess)  now a respected gospel artist. On the day of the album\'s recording  Aretha\'s father arrives to be a part; he apologizes to Aretha for the pain he has caused her. The service begins and Aretha is introduced. As she makes her way to the front of the church  she greets each of her family members - but does not acknowledge her father. She ascends to the stage and sings her arrangement of the hymn  Amazing Grace. Her live album of the same name became the highest-selling album of her career  earning a double platinum certification with over two million copies sold in the United States.' , 'Find Out What It Means'  'Her Voice Changed Everything'  'The Queen Arrives'

She proceeds with the presentation  where she uses her pet squid Socrates\' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved. The experiment is a success  but when Wednesday goes up to accept what she thinks will be a first place prize  she finds that everyone got a trophy for their efforts. Her work  however  gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange  who appears through a holographic projection to let her know he thinks her work is brilliant. Meanwhile  Pugsley attempts to impress girls by tweaking another kid\'s volcano project  but it ends up causing a huge disaster in the gym that sends everyone running.Back at the Addams home  Wednesday and Pugsley decline to show up for dinner. Fester goes up to Pugsley\'s room to try and help him find a way to woo the ladies. Wednesday sends her parents a very specific note for why she isn\'t coming to dinner. Gomez worries that the kids are drifting apart from him and Morticia  so he decides to take them on a family vacation.Gomez brings out a hideous road vehicle and gets Thing  Fester  the kids  and Lurch to join him and Morticia on the road while Grandmama stays behind to take care of the house. Before they hit the road  a lawyer named Mr. Mustela approaches Gomez and Morticia with the implication that Wednesday was switched as a baby at the hospital  meaning she may not really be an Addams  but the two ignore him and think it\'s just Wednesday trying to get out of going on the trip  but she says that she doesn\'t know who that man is. Once the family is gone  Grandmama throws a huge party. On the road  Mustela and his hulking henchman Pongo pursue the Addams family.The family is initially set on going to Salem  but Fester ends up making a detour to Niagara Falls because he is suddenly obsessed with water due to him mutating because of Wednesday\'s experiment with the squid. Pugsley tries to make another attempt with girls per Fester\'s advice  but his cheesy line backfires. Wednesday gets a voodoo doll of him and uses Pugsley to perform some dance moves  until she just tosses the doll over the Falls to torment her brother. When Gomez and Morticia attempt to bond with Wednesday  she snubs them. They then spot Mustela and Pongo looking for them  and Fester ends up knocking Mustela into the water before recovering Pugsley.The family then stops in Sleepy Hollow where they set up camp. While gathered around the fire  Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday  so Fester mentions a story from the night Wednesday was born where he went into the delivery room to see her  but all the other babies were crying  so he employed an Addams family tradition of putting babies to sleep by taking them out of their beds and juggling them all  potentially mixing up many babies in the process. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia\'s fears that Wednesday was switched. Wednesday overhears the discussion and muses to Lurch about where she might really come from.Gomez brings everyone to Miami in an attempt to get in touch with Cousin Itt so he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio where he talks to Wednesday about his own rebellious phase in his youth  but he essentially says he owned up to who he really is. When Grandmama calls him to help with the house party since she let it get out of hand  Itt must bail. Mustela and Pongo almost catch up with them  but Lurch knocks them away.To hide from their pursuers  the family goes to a motel where they enter a displeased Wednesday into a girls beauty pageant where she creates a scene. Mustela enters  but is distracted long enough for the family to escape.The Addams\' stop at the Grand Canyon where Itt flies off from them  and Morticia gives Wednesday a necklace containing the blood of the Addams family members. Pugsley blows up the canyon  drawing more unwanted attention. Meanwhile  Fester starts to mutate further into a squid-man. Wednesday goes off by herself where Mustela attempts to get her again  but she gets the drop on him and traps him. His phone rings  and she sees that he was employed by Cyrus Strange  who suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and that he is inviting her to stay with him in Sausalito where she can hone in her potential in science. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez\'s hair  which seemingly proves that she most certainly is not his daughter.Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep  but Lurch catches up with her to keep her safe. The rest of her family learns where she is headed and go after her. Wednesday and Lurch stop at a biker bar to ask for help in getting to Sausalito  which they do after Lurch shows off his piano and singing skills by performing  I Will Survive . The bikers then escort the two to Sausalito.Wednesday arrives at Cyrus\'s home and meets his wife Ingrid  a bird-like humanoid being  and their pig-like daughter  Ophelia. Cyrus brings her to his lab where he shows her a formula he developed much like Wednesday\'s own that she used on Fester regarding human-animal hybrids. The rest of the Addams clan shows up  but Wednesday seems fully set on staying with Cyrus and no longer accepting them as her family. While Gomez and Morticia are sad  Pugsley tries to bond with Ophelia since they seem to be mutually attracted. However  Ophelia morphs into a pig  as that is what she originally was. When Pugsley brings this revelation to his parents  Cyrus reveals the truth and that he was just using Wednesday since her formula works better than his own. He then captures the family.Cyrus traps the clan in tubes where he plans to mutate them with his formula. He shows them to Wednesday so that she may remove any traits of theirs that she doesn\'t like  but she doesn\'t like seeing them trapped this way. She turns on Cyrus  but when he tries to have Pongo go after her and Lurch  it is then revealed that Lurch and Pongo knew each other and were really good friends at the asylum they were locked up at before Lurch was found by Gomez and Morticia. Pongo warned Lurch with a look that Wednesday was in danger. Together  the two brutes free the Addams family and knock Cyrus into a tube where he is doused with his potion. It turns him into a gigantic animal hybrid monster. When he goes after the family  Fester comes out as a giant squid monster  and the two fight until they both tumble out the window. Cyrus falls to his death while Fester pulls himself up with his tentacle  but he is now weakened. Wednesday uses the blood in the necklace that Morticia gave her  and Fester turns back to normal and is revived. Wednesday decides she is proud to be an Addams and reunites with her family.The family returns home  with Ophelia joining them as a regular human girl  where Itt has helped Grandmama turn the party around. While Wednesday knows Cyrus fabricated the DNA test results  she wonders how her test came out so that she isn\'t related to Gomez. He reveals his hair is a toupee  but that she is 100% his daughter. The family then goes on another road trip around the world.' , 'A sequel. How original.'  'Back on the big scream.'  'Unhappy to see you again.'

Carol is a successful chef  while Tim is a stay at home husband and cares for the kids.Tim\'s younger brother Ted (Alec Baldwin) (a former executive of Baby Corp  Tim\'s younger brother) is now a successful CEO and is never around  but sends lavish gifts to the family. Tabitha is exhibiting more grown-up behavior  and one night while Tim wonders about the person his daughter is becoming  he hears something from Tina\'s room. He discovers that Tina is from Baby Corp  just as Ted once was  and that she has been assigned to get Ted there for a special mission. Tim refuses to call Ted  saying that he will never come (as he cares for nothing but his work)  and encourages Tina to go back to sleep. However  Tina leaves a fake voicemail for Ted (using Tim\'s recorded voice)  luring him to the Templetons\' house.The next morning  Ted arrives and Tim explains to him that Tina is a Baby Corp dispatch. Tina introduces the brothers to a new formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to infiltrate Tabitha\'s school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum)  founder and principal of the school  is planning behind parents\' backs. Dr Erwin espouses that parents are holding their kids back and Tim believes that he is the reason why Tabitha has been growing ever more distant from him.\nTim and Ted hide from Carol and leave her a note that they are going on a brother bonding trip. This is a good cover for them to complete their mission.At the school  Tim  now as his 7-year-old self  follows Tabitha to her class while baby Ted is placed with other babies. Ted rallies the babies to help him get out of the playroom so that he can go to Armstrong\'s office to investigate. Tim tries to get sent to the principal\'s office by disrupting class  but is instead put in  The Box  for timeout. Ted discovers that Armstrong is actually a baby himself (and has just built a grown up body around himself)  having run away from home after realizing that he was smarter than his parents and now makes money by creating popular phone apps (all of these apps are created by babies who code). His ultimate plan is to get rid of every parent on B-Day (Baby revolution day)  so that they cannot tell their children what to do anymore.Tim finds that Tabitha is excelling in her class  except for music. She struggles with the notes and this is putting her performance in the upcoming holiday pageant at risk. Tim speaks to Tabitha (as her classmate Marcos Lightspeed) and understands that Tabitha wants her dad Tim to be proud of her.Tim gets invited by Carol to her house  as Tabitha\'s friend. There he meets his own parents Ted Templeton Sr. (Jimmy Kimmel) & Janice Templeton (Lisa Kudrow)  who tell  Marcos  that Tim is an unreliable dad.

However  they learn that B-Day is set to happen that night through Armstrong\'s new app  QT-Snap  which will hypnotize the parents into mindless zombies. Tina tries to organize Ted to try and turn off the master power switch  that will stop the app upload. Tim stops Ted  since Tabitha is due to perform shortly. Both Tim and Ted are caught by Armstrong\'s ninja babies and are put in The Box  which slowly starts to fill with water. Tabitha sings her solo  but when she sees that Tim has not showed up  she runs off the stage crying. She is consoled by Tina  who reveals her identity and her mission. Tabitha agrees to help her younger sister by getting to the server and shutting down QT-Snap before it can go worldwide. Ted is able to call Precious  Tabitha\'s pet pony  into the school  as she breaks them out of The Box.Tim and Ted reach the server first  but they are stopped by Armstrong  who calls the zombie parents for backup. Tabitha realizes that Marcos is really Tim. While the brothers hold them back as the formula starts to wear off  Tina and Tabitha get up to the server. Tabitha is able to hack in and pull up the shutdown screen  but is interrupted by Armstrong.

After settling into their rooms  Trent befriends a young boy named Idlib (Kailen Jude)  and they do activities like ask other resort patrons what their names and jobs are  and Idlib shows Trent a special code to decipher messages. Meanwhile  Guy and Prisca discuss that this is just one last trip they wanted to give the kids before they divorce  which is made worse because Prisca is suffering from a stomach tumor.At breakfast  a middle-aged doctor named Charles (Rufus Sewell) is sitting with his younger vain wife Chrystal (Abbey Lee)  daughter Kara (Kyle Bailey)  and his mother Agnes (Kathleen Chalfant). Nearby  a woman named Patricia (Nikki Amuka-Bird) is having an epileptic seizure  which Charles helps with while her husband Jarin (Ken Leung) also tries to help. Trent also spots Idlib  as they made plans to hang out again that day  but the resort manager (Gustaf Hammarsten) makes him leave the area.The Kapas  plus Charles and his family  all board a van that takes them to a private beach. There  Maddox recognizes a rapper  Mid-Size Sedan/real name Brendan Smith (Aaron Pierre)  who was earlier seen with a female companion who went skinny-dipping. The kids all play together while the adults lounge on the sand. The girls find old dolls buried in the sand  left behind by other kids. Trent swims by a cave when he discovers the body of Brendan\'s companion  apparently having drowned. The adults examine the body  while Brendan is suffering from nosebleeds and is equally stunned at the discovery. Charles suspects Brendan of foul play  though he maintains that the woman only went for a swim and never came back. Not long after  Agnes begins to fall short of breath before she also dies.Jarin and Patricia arrive at the beach as well  but the people who brought them are already gone. The kids also start to experience something weird. Brendan explains to the adults that the woman he was with had multiple sclerosis while he has hemophilia  which explains his constant nosebleeds. Jarin and Patricia talk to Trent and Maddox  who have suddenly aged up into pre-teenagers (Trent now played by Luca Faustino Rodriguez  Maddox played by Thomasin McKenzie)  along with Kara (now played by Mikayla Fisher).Several attempts are made to leave the beach  by going through the rocks that close off the beach from the outside  but all the adults that attempt to pass through feel a pounding in their heads before they black out and end up back on the beach. They also notice unusual things  like when Charles attacks Brendan with a knife  the slash mark heals within seconds. Not long after  Brendan finds that the dead body of the woman he was with has now fully decomposed to nothing but bones within hours  making them realize that there is something time-related occurring on the beach. Suddenly  the tumor in Prisca\'s stomach starts to cause her pain and distress. The adults try to help her  with them feeling around for the tumor at first and describing it as the size of a golf ball. They proceed to perform a surgery to remove the tumor  which has now grown to the size of a cantaloupe. The cut in Prisca\'s stomach heals rapidly after the procedure.Trent and Kara age up even more into teenagers/young adults (Trent now played by Alex Wolff  Kara played by Eliza Scanlen). What\'s more is that Kara has somehow become five months pregnant within a matter of minutes (after apparently having sex with Trent minutes earlier. The adults prepare themselves for the birth  which happens rather quickly  but the baby dies after a minute due to lack of attention. The other adults start to show more visible signs of aging  but Chrystal takes the process much harder than the others.Charles starts to lose his mind to schizophrenia  leading him to stab Brendan to death. The others take his weapon away while trying to come up with an alternate plan of escape. Knowing they can\'t go through the rocks  Jarin attempts to swim to find a way out. While this happens  Trent and Maddox come across a notebook left by a previous visitor  with names and medical conditions written down. They also notice what looks like people in the distance observing them.Maddox talks to Prisca about whether or not she and Guy are splitting up. Prisca admits that she was seeing another man. Although Prisca tries to explain herself  Maddox is angry with her. She goes out to the beach and attempts to be strong and find a way out herself  but she finds Jarin\'s body  apparently having gone unconscious and drowned. Upon seeing his body  Patricia suffers a fatal seizure. Kara then desperately tries to find a way out and starts climbing up the rocks to try and make it to the top  but before she can make it high enough  she too blacks out and falls to her death  leaving Trent devastated.It is now nighttime. Charles has become fully unhinged while Chrystal is also losing her mind at her rapid aging and declining physical state (she has grown a calcium hump on her back). Guy is also losing his eyesight  and Prisca is noticeably grayer. Guy and Prisca talk about the other man in Prisca\'s life  with Guy admitting he knew about him and wished that he did more to keep their marriage working  but he also notes that the other guy is a loser and that she deserves someone better. Charles then starts to attack Guy and Prisca  while Trent and Maddox are attacked by Chrystal when they try to look at her. She follows them into the cave and her body becomes twisted and contorted to horrible angles before she dies there. Prisca then slashes Charles with a rusty knife  causing an infection that rapidly spreads through his body and kills him.The Kapas then gather around the campfire and the beach. The now elderly Guy is having a hard time speaking and remembering things  but he essentially admits to Prisca that he still loves her just before he dies. Prisca then stands up for a moment but collapses and dies by Guy\'s side while both kids mourn their parents.In the morning  Trent and Maddox are now in their 50\'s (Trent played by Emun Elliott  Maddox played by Embeth Davidtz). Trent brings up a code that Idlib gave him  which he deciphered and figured out means  My uncle doesn\'t like the coral . The siblings spot a coral reef nearby and realize that it must be their way out. The two swim out there  but Maddox\'s clothing gets stuck on the coral. When the two don\'t resurface  Theo  the van driver that brought the families to the beach (director M. Night Shyamalan) reports to his bosses  from his observation post on a cliff overlooking the beach  that all members of  Trial 73  have perished.When Theo drives back to the resort and to a lab area  it is then revealed that the resort is a front for a medical research team named Warren & Warren that lures people with medical conditions to the beach in order to perform clinical trials for life-saving drugs  given to them in the cocktails served upon arriving. They know that the supernatural beach (possibly powered by the mystical coral) speeds up the aging process  so they reduce the trials to a whole day for better results. They believe they cured Patricia\'s epilepsy since she didn\'t have a seizure for eight hours  which is equivalent to about 16 years on the beach.The resort manager and others attempt to poach their latest victims until they are stopped by Trent and Maddox  who managed to free themselves from the coral.

However  after Lucky lets a squirrel in their house and ruins her grandfather\'s campaign party (James is a railroad baron  who is now running for GOvernor of the state)  she and Cora head to the western town of Miradero (James wont speak to Fortuna and asks Cora to take her away) where they will stay with Lucky\'s father Jim (Jake Gyllenhaal)  whom Lucky has not really known of after the incident with Milagro  for the summer. On the train over  Lucky notices a mustang running with his herd  and goes to the back of the train to meet him. Upon arriving in Miradero  the pair meet local young riders Pru Granger (Marsai Martin) (who is a rodeo rider) (and her father Al (Andre Braugher))  and Abigail Stone (Mckenna Grace) (and her brother Snips (Lucian Perez)  who has a donkey named Carrots). Abigail has a horse named Boomerang.\nFortuna is awkward with Jim  since she cant figure out why Jim abandoned her after the death of Milgaro. Fortuna finds her mother\'s old room in Jim\'s house.The next day  Lucky goes to a corral where she sees the same horse from before trying to be abusively manhandled by a man named Hendricks (Walton Goggins). Hendricks is an outlaw and had seen the mustang with his herd from the train (he was on the same train as Fortuna).\nLucky tells Jim and Cora about the horse  thinking he can be her new friend  but Jim does not want Lucky going near the horses after what happened to Milagro. Nonetheless  Pru and Abigail help Lucky win over the trust of the horse (Lucky entices the mustang with apples)  whom she names Spirit. After a while  Spirit trusts Lucky enough to eat an apple she offers him  and allows her to pet him  sealing their bond.Lucky attempts to ride Spirit but he escapes from the corral and runs away  while Lucky is saved by Pru and Abigail after almost falling off a cliff.

She enlists Pru and Abigail with their horses to embark on a journey to try and cut the wranglers off on their path by beating them to a water depot located beyond a summit called Heck Mountain (which is near impossible to cross on horseback  but allows them to shortcut the train to the docks  where Hendricks will load the horses on a boat). During the trip  Lucky builds up her relationship with Spirit  and becomes good friends with Pru and Abigail as they travel.\nTheir plan is to reach a water depot  where the train has to stop to refill its water  before Hendricks gets there and ambush the train.The girls reach the water depot the night before the wranglers are set to arrive  but Lucky wakes up the next day realizing the wranglers made it earlier than expected.

One night  Brianna\'s brother Troy (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) shares the urban legend of Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen)  a white graduate student who went on a killing spree in the early 1990s. The story goes that her rampage culminated in a bonfire outside the Cabrini-Green projects  at which point she attempted to sacrifice an infant child. The residents were able to rescue the child from Helen before she perished in the fire in an apparent act of self-immolation.Desperate for a creative spark to turn his career around  Anthony latches on to this story and roams around Cabrini-Green looking for inspiration. He eventually has a chance encounter with William Burke (Colman Domingo)  a launderette owner who introduces him to the story of Candyman. When Burke was a child  he had a frightening encounter with Sherman Fields (Michael Hargrove)  a hook-handed man whom the police believed was responsible for putting a razor blade in a piece of candy that ended up in the hands of a white girl. Burke inadvertently alerted the police to his presence in the walls of one of the tower blocks  leading them to beat Sherman to death. Sherman was later exonerated when more children received candy with razor blades. The legend goes that repeating the name  Candyman  five times in front of a mirror invokes Sherman\'s spirit  at which point he appears in the reflection and kills whoever spoke his name.Inspired by this  Anthony develops an art exhibit around the legend of Candyman and showcases it at Brianna\'s gallery but is dismayed when he does not get the kind of reaction he was hoping for. That night  one of Brianna\'s co-workers and his girlfriend are slaughtered by Candyman after saying his name five times in front of a mirror. Their bodies are discovered in the morning by Brianna. More people are killed after repeating Candyman\'s name including an art critic and a group of teenage girls.Meanwhile  Anthony begins to undergo a physical transformation stemming from a bee sting he suffered on his hand while walking around Cabrini-Green. The sting develops into a scab that begins to spread and cover his whole body. Anthony later goes to a hospital to get checked out  where he learns that his mother lied about where he was born. Anthony soon pays a visit to his mother (Vanessa Williams)  who reveals he was the baby Helen Lyle saved from the fire the night she died. Though the truth is that Helen saved him from Candyman  who abducted him and planned to sacrifice him in the fire  she never told him about it because she wanted Anthony to have a chance at a normal life. The community had vowed never to repeat the legend of Candyman after that night and his mother fears what will happen to Anthony now that someone has broken their pact. Anthony leaves resigned to his fate and wanders the row houses of Cabrini-Green.Concerned about Anthony  Brianna recalls him mentioning that he first heard about Candyman from Burke  so she heads to Cabrini-Green in hopes of finding him. Once there  Burke subdues Brianna and takes her to an abandoned church  where Anthony has entered a fugue state as his body continues to deteriorate.Burke reveals that not only did he witness the police beat Sherman to death but he also saw Sherman return later as the Candyman after which he butchered his older sister when she summoned him in the bathroom mirror of their apartment. He plans to have Anthony gunned down by the police  creating a new legend in which Candyman is an instrument of vengeance rather than a symbol of Black pain and suffering. To complete Anthony\'s transformation into Candyman  he saws off his right hand and replaces it with a hook.Brianna manages to escape the church and is chased into the Cabrini Green row houses by Burke  whom she viciously stabs to death. Anthony appears and collapses into her arms as the police  lured to the scene by Burke  show up and shoot Anthony to death. Brianna is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police SUV  where an officer attempts to intimidate her into agreeing that Anthony provoked the other officer into shooting him.

They absorbed souls  turning those into stone. Eventually  the dragons of Kumandra used what was left of their magic to create an orb that not only warded off the Druun  but also restored everyone to life  with the exception of the dragons who remained turned to stone. The people all wanted the power of the orb which ultimately divided them into tribes based on their placement of a giant river made to resemble a dragon: Fang  Heart  Tail  Spine and Talon. Heart Tribe acquired the orb and has been guarding it ever since.500 years later  Chief Benga of the Heart Tribe has been training his daughter Raya to guard the orb. Despite this  he still believes that all the nations will set aside their differences and become Kumandra again. He resolves to invite all the nations over for a feast. Raya ends up befriending the daughter of Chief Virana of the Fang Tribe  Namaari  due to their shared interest in dragons. Namaari gives Raya a dragon pendant and she in turn shows her the location of the orb. However  Namaari betrays Raya and soon the Fang Tribe attempt to steal the orb. The rest of the tribes find out and a fight breaks out  resulting in the orb smashing to pieces. The Druun suddenly reawaken as each of the tribes steal a piece. Raya tries to rescue Benga  but he tells her to flee with the piece she has as he turns to stone.Six years later  Raya has been searching for the end of a stream to summon Sisu  the dragon who supposedly created the orb and the only surviving member of the species  to help her recover the missing orb pieces. She ends up in what is left of the desert like Tail Tribe and manages to summon Sisu. She admits that she did not create the orb and that her older siblings did  but finds that she can use their powers when she holds onto a piece. They find what is left of the Tail Temple and recover the second piece with Sisu now gaining the ability to turn into a human. They encounter Namaari and her tribe  but the two of them manage to escape on a boat driven by a young entrepreneur named Boun  who had lost his family to the Druun. Despite Boun being friendly  Raya refuses to divulge that Sisu is a dragon  nor tell him of her quest  confusing Sisu.They arrive at the Talon Tribe  who have built their homes over the water to protect themselves against the Druun  as Raya tries to find their leader so that she can reclaim the orb piece. While out in the town  Raya encounters a  con baby  named Little Noi and her trio of monkey-like companions the Ongis  who adopted her after her mother was lost to the Druun. After a chase  Raya decides to hire them to help her. Sisu goes into town to look for a gift  as she thinks it is better than fighting  only to run into the real tribe leader who threatens her. Raya rescues her and reclaims the piece  which allows Sisu to make smoke clouds  and make it back to Boun with Noi and the Ongis joining them.The group arrive at the Spine Tribe with Raya and Sisu attempting to enter the village. They are caught by the sole survivor of the tribe  a fearsome warrior named Tong  who actually does not know what to do with them. The rest of the group arrive to warn them of Namaari\'s arrival. Raya holds her off in a fight while the others escape. However  Sisu reverts to her dragon form and fends off Namaari and the Fang Tribe. Before leaving  Namaari is moved by the appearance of Sisu. She returns to Virana to tell her  but she instead demands that she reclaim the pieces and the dragon as she fears that the other tribes will try to take what they have. Back at the boat  Raya finally comes clean to her party about Sisu and they agree to work together with Tong giving the orb piece he had been guarding and allowing Sisu to gain the ability to summon the rains.As they get close to the Fang Tribe  Raya suggests breaking in to reclaim the final piece  but Sisu suggests giving them a gift and asking it back. When Raya refuses  Sisu takes her back to what is left of the Heart Tribe and reveals the fate of her siblings. While Sisu did not create the orb  her siblings trusted her enough to do the right thing with it. Raya gives in and decides to give Namaari the dragon pendant as a piece offering so that she can rejoin the rest of the orb pieces. Raya and Sisu meet privately with Namaari  but as soon as she shows the remainder of the orb pieces  Namaari holds a crossbow to them. Sisu tries to talk her down  but Raya  sensing that Namaari will shoot  attacks her  causing Sisu to get hit by the arrow and falls into a river. Namaari flees as the water  which protected the Fang Tribe against the Druun  begins to recede.The Fang Tribe is attacked by the Druun as Raya enters to confront Namaari  who is grieving Virana\'s fate at the hands of the Druun. The two fight while Tong  Boun  Noi and the Ongis rescue the people from the Druun. Raya prepares to strike down Namaari  but she tells her that she has lost everything and does not care anymore. Raya comes to her senses and she goes to help her friends. Namaari in turn helps the group using her orb piece. As the pieces start losing power  they fall into a pit and are surrounded by the Druun. Raya tells them that they need to put the pieces together  but her friends refuse to help Namaari. To show her faith  Raya puts her piece down and allows the Druun to take her. One by the one the rest follow with Namaari putting the pieces together and getting consumed by the Druun afterwards. The plan works and the Druun are vanquished as everyone is brought back to life.The dragons are all brought back to life as they revive Sisu who thanks Raya for trusting others. Everyone returns to their significant others as Raya returns home to be reunited with Benga. She introduces him to Sisu as all the tribes come together peacefully to celebrate.' ,nan

She narrowly avoids Prince Joachim  a German aristocrat who also wants the arrowhead and the tree.In South America  Frank Wolff takes tourists on jungle river cruises  which he embellishes with fake dangers and corny jokes. When his boat engine is repossessed by businessman Nilo  he attempts to steal it back. Caught in the act by Lily  Frank pretends to be Nilo and arrogantly tells her that the Tears of the Moon is a myth and that she will not be able to handle the dangers of the jungle  but changes his tone when he notices that Lily is in possession of the arrowhead.

202.064929,2021,Eternals,200,156,6.3,2301.649025,20211105,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,  In 5000 B.C.  a group of ten immortal individuals descend upon Earth to protect humanity from the Deviants. They are the Eternals  who have been sent from their home planet of Olympia on the Domo by the Prime Celestial: Arishem the Judge. Throughout the centuries  the Eternals continue to relocate to other growing civilizations and defend them from the Deviants  although they are barred by Arishem from interfering with human conflicts to allow them to evolve naturally. Two Eternals  Sersi and Ikaris  would develop a close relationship over the centuries  eventually becoming a married couple.In 1521  the Spanish invasion on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan runs concurrently with an attack from the last of the Deviants. While fighting them off  Thena's Mahd Wy'ry causes her to momentarily turn on her allies  only to be stopped by Gilgamesh. The Prime Eternal  Ajak  offers to cure Thena's affliction at the cost of her memories  but Gilgamesh volunteers to look over her  conceding with the possibility that she may have to be killed if she turns again. Druig  frustrated with how the Eternals have been abstaining from human affairs  deserts them to end the Spanish conflict himself. With the Deviants seemingly eradicated  Ajak releases the Eternals to go their own ways. In the years since  Ikaris would abandon Sersi as the other Eternals await their return to Olympia.In the present day  Sprite lives with Sersi in London as she works as a museum curator with a romantic interest in her colleague Dane Whitman. One night  Sersi  Sprite and Whitman are leaving a party when they are attacked by a Deviant. They are joined by Ikaris as they fight to eradicate the beast  but they discover that it is able to heal itself. As Whitman is left behind  Sersi  Sprite and Ikaris decide to leave for South Dakota in search of Ajak. At her house  they find her body instead  a victim of an earlier Deviant attack. As Sersi mourns over the cadaver of their leader  Ajak passes on the sphere she uses to communicate with Arishem to her. With the Deviant threat looming  the three decide to venture out to find the other Eternals.They approach Kingo as he shoots a new Bollywood film  who is hesitant to leave his life of stardom and rejoin the Eternals. He gives in when he learns about Ajak  alongside additional encouragement from his valet Karun Patel  who also tags alongside them to film a documentary for Kingo. The group locates Gilgamesh and Thena in Australia as the latter's Wy'ry resurfaces due to a recent Deviant attack. After examining Thena's artwork she had painted during her episodes of Wy'ry  which visualized memories of planetary destructions in the past  Sersi uses the sphere to successfully establish a connection to Arishem. The Prime Celestial reveals to Sersi that Olympia does not actually exist- instead  he had engineered the Eternals in the World Forge. He had also created the Deviants to eradicate Earth's apex predators and allow intelligent life to thrive  but a critical design flaw led them to evolve and become predators themselves.So  the Eternals were deployed onto Earth to protect the humans  unaware that they were also defending a seed that would spawn the new Celestial Tiamut the Communicator once the population quota of intelligent life was achieved. When that happens  the Emergence would commence  resulting in the destruction of the planet and the birth of said Celestial  which would allow for new life and galaxies to form. Afterwards  the memories of the Eternals would be taken from them and studied by Arishem to make way for their next planetary mission. Appalled with the true meaning of their existence  Sersi informs the others. Together  they realize that Thena's mental affliction was the result of a botched memory wipe after a previous Emergence.Hoping to delay the Emergence  they find Druig in an Amazon village in hopes that he could be able utilize his telepathy to render Tiamut the Communicator dormant  but he is hesitant to help them. At night  they are ambushed by the Deviants and fight to fend them off. Ikaris and Sersi are viciously attacked by one of the beasts  but she uses her powers to transmute it into a tree  to everyone's surprise. As Thena begins to fall insane yet again  Gilgamesh rushes to her side. However  this allows the Deviant leader Kro to attack him and absorb his powers  gaining a humanoid figure  intelligible speech  and his memories.Before fleeing  Kro pledges to kill the Eternals for their actions towards the Deviants. With his last words  Gilgamesh successfully gets Thena to remember who she is  curing her of the affliction. The rest of the Eternals mourn the loss of their strongest fighter with a cremation  with Thena scattering his ashes in the river. Druig proclaims that he is not powerful enough to affect a Celestial  so they head to Chicago to seek out Phastos  who had long abandoned mankind and his technological ambitions after his technology was used to create the atomic bomb. However  he has newfound hope for humanity after finding a new life with his husband Ben Stoss and son Jack Stoss. He initially refuses to leave his family  but relents after Ben convinces him to fight for Jack's future.Heading to Iraq  they retrieve the Domo from an archaeological site and find Makkari residing in the ship. As they all are imbued with infinite cosmic energy  Phastos proposes they channel their energy into Druig and form a Uni-Mind so that he can take control of the Celestial and stop the Emergence. But not everyone is onboard with the plan  with Ikaris being the primary dissident. When Kingo pledges to remain alongside Ikaris up until the end  he recalls his last encounter with Ajak six days prior. She informs Ikaris that although the Blip brought the Emergence closer to reality  the heroics of the Avengers inspired her to doubt Arishem for the first time. But as he remains a firm believer in Arishem  Ikaris takes Ajak to a town in Alaska  where the Deviants trapped in ice were resurfacing due to global warming associated with the Emergence. He pushes her into the path of Kro  who absorbs her life force and gains her hyper-regenerative powers. Ikaris takes Ajak's body back home before breaking down over what he had done.Sersi senses the commencement of the Emergence  prompting Phastos to send Makkari out and find Tiamut  who is at a volcanic island in the Indian Ocean. Druig deduces Ikaris' role in Ajak's death  and Sersi learns he was made aware of their true mission by Ajak centuries ago. Ikaris argues that it is their duty as Eternals to protect the Celestial cycle of life so that the universe may continue to exist. When Kingo threatens to attack Ikaris  Sprite decides to leave with him. As he does not want to face Arishem but wishes not to fight his friends  Kingo also departs along with Karun. Thena convinces Sersi to continue Ajak's mission as her successor and prevent the Emergence from eliminating all of mankind. To facilitate the Uni-Mind  Phastos takes Sersi's communication sphere and disassembles it to construct bracelets for the other Eternals to wear.At the island  Sersi  Thena and Makkari lend their energy to Druig and allow him to connect with Tiamut  but Ikaris blasts him into a hole and destroys the Domo. Determining that Sersi's matter transmutation powers are their last chance to stop the Emergence  Makkari  Thena and Phastos confront Ikaris to give her cover. Kro attacks the Eternals and nearly kills Makkari  but Phastos knocks him into a cave where Thena follows him into. Sprite projects an illusion of Ajak to distract Sersi before stabbing her with a dagger. As she is constantly mocked for her childlike stature  Sprite envies Sersi for being able to live a full life among humans  hoping that the Emergence's aftermath would allow her to be reborn as a full-sized lifeform. Druig recovers and knocks Sprite out  but he is unable to utilize his powers against Tiamut again  forcing Sersi to face it alone as the Celestial begins to rise from Earth's crust.Kro impersonates Gilgamesh and attempts to take over Thena's mind  but she is able to resist him and kills the Deviant. Phastos manages to restrain Ikaris and prevent him from using his powers momentarily  but he eventually breaks free and flies away to stop Sersi. However  he is emotionally unable to bring himself to harm her. Remembering their time on Earth and the love they shared  he surrenders. Despite this  Sersi still doesn't have enough energy to kill Tiamut  however  suddenly something unites all the Eternals - including Ikaris and Sprite - into the Uni-Mind  attaining enough energy to allow Sersi to transform Tiamut's body into marble. Guilt-ridden  Ikaris apologizes to Sersi before fleeing Earth  flying directly into the Sun. Phastos deduces that it was Tiamut itself that initiated the Uni-Mind - this was always the way for Eternals to survive destructions of planets  but this time it resulted in the Celestial's death. Having retained some energy from the Uni-Mind  Sersi fulfills Sprite's wishes and transmutes her into a human to allow her to grow up.Two weeks later in South Dakota  Thena  Makkari and Druig depart for space on the Domo  which had been repaired by Phastos  in search for more Eternals and tell them the truth. Back in London  Sprite bids goodbye to Sersi as she moves out with Kingo to attend school. Whitman professes his love for her and is about to reveal a secret regarding his family history  when suddenly Arishem appears outside Earth's orbit and lifts Sersi  Kingo and Phastos into space. Displeased with their treason  Arishem says he will spare humanity if the Eternals' memories show that the humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgement  before taking the trio with him into a singularity.In a mid-credits scene: Thena  Makkari and Druig meet the Eternal Eros  Thanos' brother and his assistant Pip the Troll  who offer their help.In a post-credits scene: Whitman opens a case containing the legendary Ebony Blade when an unseen person questions whether he is ready for it.  , 'In the beginning...'

Kayla saves the day by suggesting a dog park where Ben can take Spike for an evening walk discreetly.As the couple and their pets are escorted to their room  Jerry's presence is revealed (when he runs through the kitchen for a piece of cheese)   which puts the wedding and the hotel at risk. Kayla offers to catch Jerry  but fails and realizes that he'll be hard to catch. After many failed attempts  Tom successfully enters the hotel  and his ensuing chase after Jerry wrecks a hotel room. Due to noise complaints  Kayla comes to check  but she befriends Tom  due to their shared goal of catching Jerry. Owner Mr. Dubros (Rob Delaney) (a jovial general manager and owner of the Royal Gate Hotel) hires Tom to exterminate Jerry on Kayla's recommendation  while Tom and Kayla's boss Terence (Michael Pe??a) (the event manager of the Royal Gate Hotel) threatens to fire them  if Tom can't catch Jerry.After many failed attempts (Jerry gets Tom to attack Spike.

Kayla talks to Preeta about why she doesn't push back Ben as she clearly doesn't want a huge wedding. Preeta simply says that she is trying to maintain an image of what is expected of her.A vengeful Terence separately visits Tom and Jerry  and feeds them lies of what they said about each other behind their back. Tom and Jerry are eventually released from the pound Terence and taken back to the hotel. Terence's words incite them to a battle at the ceremony that throws the wedding into carnage (jerry spooks the Elephants  who do the rest) and destroys the rest of the hotel.After Kayla comes clean and leaves in humiliation  Terence evicts Tom and Preeta renounces the wedding.

While the pair lure Preeta and Toots to Central Park  where the wedding is held at. Kayla promises to Preeta that Tom and Jerry have atoned for their behavior  and Ben apologizes to Preeta for his extensive expenses  in light of impressing her dad.

Kong is getting too big for the electronic dome under which he has been kept and Ilene knows that he won\'t last in there much longer. But if Kong leaves Skull Island  Godzilla will come for him  as there can\'t be 2 alphas.Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry)  an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast  extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility (shipping manifests to Apex\'s facility in Hong Kong and designs of a massive machine). However  Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility  during the rampage  Bernie stumbles on a massive device.Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown)  a fan of Bernie\'s podcast (The daughter of Monarch scientists Mark and the late Emma Russell. Madison believes there is a reason for Godzilla\'s erratic behavior  suspecting a conspiracy formulated by the Apex Cybernetics (She believes something at Apex provoked Godzilla))  enlists her friend Josh (Julian Dennison) to investigate Godzilla\'s attacks.Apex CEO Walter Simmons (Demi??n Bichir) (Maia\'s father  CEO  and founder of Apex Cybernetics  a tech organization invested in trying to solve the Earth\'s  Titan problem   secretly creating Mechagodzilla to exterminate them) recruits Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg??rd) (A Monarch geologist and chief cartographer who works closely with Kong and charts the mission into the Hollow Earth)  former Monarch scientist  and Hollow Earth theorist  to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth  the home world of the Titans. Walter convinces Nathan that the new power source is required to keep the titans in check.Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs (Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle)  specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. The entries to hollow earth can only be opened by a titan.\nNathan  Ilene  and an Apex team led by Walter\'s daughter Maia (Eiza Gonz??lez) board a modified barge escorted by the U.S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Kong is kept under control by Jia. Irene is astounded to learn that Kong understands sign language.Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong (Nathan releases Kong\'s shackles after Godzilla tilts the barge on which Kong and the entire Apex team was hosted. Kong manages to push back Godzilla enough to set the barge upright and save Jia) (Kong shifts the battle to the aircraft carrier to protect Jia. Godzilla uses his atomic breath to destroy the carrier. Kong can\'t breathe underwater and is defeated easily) but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla  Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance  and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel (as there is no way for Kong to survive in the cold Antarctic climate and fleet was destroyed getting there) while the team follows him in the HEAVs.Madison and Josh find Bernie (Madison tracks the sales of bleach as Bernie uses bleach to avoid all organic tracking technology)  who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base  discover a secret facility underground  and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong  where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri) (Apex\'s chief technology officer)  the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa  through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head but is hobbled by its power supply\'s limitations. Ren is using home grown skull crawlers to train himself in using the Mechagodzilla (it has a laser breath). Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth\'s energy to overcome Mechagodzilla\'s limitations.Inside the Hollow Earth  Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island (with flying skull crawlers  who destroy one of the HEAVs before Kong fights them off). They discover his species\' ancestral throne room  where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla\'s kind and a glowing ax made from another Godzilla\'s dorsal plates. As they identify the power source  the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene\'s protests.\nAttracted by Mechagodzilla\'s activation  Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong  and sensing Kong  he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape in the ensuing mayhem  but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong  Ilene  Jia  and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong  where Kong engages Godzilla in a final battle. Kong initially gains the upper-hand; however  Godzilla emerges victorious after incapacitating Kong (Shoulder dislocation and cracked ribs).Madison  Josh  and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren\'s concerns over the power source\'s volatility  Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Now possessed by Ghidorah\'s consciousness  Mechagodzilla kills Walter  electrocutes Ren  and then attacks Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle  but Godzilla is overwhelmed. The laser beam is more than a match for atomic breath and soon enough Godzilla is being thrown around like a toy.Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV (Kong\'s heartbeat was weak  and Nathan uses the HEAVs engines to produce an electromagnetic pulse  large enough to give a kick start to Kong\'s heart)  and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans  Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla\'s controls with Bernie\'s flask of liquor  momentarily interrupting the Mecha. Godzilla charges Kong\'s ax with his atomic breath  allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla.

He even uses his skills to bounce the ball off the walls and kill a canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) as she assigns him to a task.Savant is thrown into Task Force X/The  Suicide Squad  (also known as Team 2) alongside Blackguard (Pete Davidson)  Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney)  Weasel (Sean Gunn)  Mongal (Mayling Ng)  Javelin (Flula Borg)  The Detachable Kid/TDK (Nathan Filion)  and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman)  the team travels to the island of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving  Weasel falls into the water and apparently drowns since nobody knew he couldn\'t swim. When the Squad makes it to land  Blackguard steps out and reveals he brought the team to the mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his troubles  he gets his face blown off. Harley goes in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature weapon to slice some heads off. TDK\'s arms pop off so he can use them as (ineffective) weapons. The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper down but it crashes and she burns to death. Boomerang is impaled with wood and then shredded by the chopper\'s blades. Harley and Flag go missing while Savant attempts to flee the chaos. Although Waller warns him  she detonates the explosive in the back of his head  causing it to blow up. She then sends in her second team to finish the job.Three days earlier.......Amanda Waller goes to recruit Robert DuBois/Bloodsport (Idris Elba)  a deadly mercenary who is there for putting Superman in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet. Her leverage against him is Bloodsport\'s teenage daughter Tyla (Storm Reid)  who is in danger of serving time for stealing. The two argue loudly  as Tyla makes it clear that Bloodsport was a bad father. He goes to threaten Waller into releasing Tyla  but she knows he is going to comply regardless. After he relents  she introduces him to her other recruits - Christopher Smith/Peacemaker (John Cena)  a patriotic mercenary; Cleo Cazo/Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior)  who has the ability to control rats and keeps one named Sebastian close by; Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone)  an underwater prince with a taste for human meat; and Abner Krill/Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian)  a man with an unusual genetic disorder whose specialty is throwing weaponized polka dots.Waller informs the team about the situation in Corto Maltese - the nation was overthrown by a dictator named Silvio Luna (Juan Diego Botto) and his right-hand man General Mateo Suarez (Joaquin Cosio) after they executed the presidential family. They are operating in a Nazi-era research facility called Jotunheim where they are conducting dangerous experiments  code-named  Project Starfish . The Squad is assigned to find Dr. Gaius Grieves/The Thinker (Peter Capaldi) since he can lead them to Jotunheim and they can destroy whatever is going on in there. We jump to the facility where Luna and Suarez are observing their work  a gigantic starfish alien creature.Presently  while Team 2 is making their way through the jungle  they come across a group that they believe to be mercenaries in league with the military  so the Squad kills them before they make it to the camp where Flag is hanging out with his contact Sol Soria (Alice Braga)  a dissident whose team  the Freedom Fighters  is trying to take Corto Maltese back from Luna and Suarez...and unfortunately her team was the group that the Squad just killed. The team walks out of the jungle when they notice Polka Dot Man glowing different colors. He explains that his condition happened because his mother worked at STAR Labs and experimented on him and his siblings to give them superpowers. His condition forces him to drain the dots out of him or he will die  and he views all of his enemies as his mother before killing them. Before heading to Jotunheim  Flag insists that they recover Harley.Harley has been taken captive by Luna\'s men  but he brings her to his room to woo her since she is seen in the country as a symbol of anti-American anarchy. Harley is initially charmed by him  and he even asks her to marry him. However  when he reveals his plan of using whatever is in Jotunheim to eliminate anyone who threatens his regime  even if it means killing children. This crosses Harley and she shoots Luna dead  leading to his men to capture and imprison her.The Squad is being taken by Sol\'s contact Milton (Julio Cesar Ruiz) to go to a bar called La Gatita Amable where they will find Thinker. On the road there  Ratcatcher asks Bloodsport why he is afraid of rats  as he is always recoiling around Sebastian even though  according to Cleo  he sees good in Bloodsport. DuBois states that his father once punished him with rats  and it lead to his phobia. When he asks her why she is so drawn to rats  she explains that her father  Ratcatcher 1 (Taika Waititi)  taught her how to control them but also treat them as family  but he was a drug addict and ultimately overdosed when she was a child. Bloodsport and Ratcatcher promise to one another that they will get each other out alive. The team makes it to the bar  but Nanaue has to stay behind since he will stick out.The Squad drinks and dances before they spot Thinker. They apprehend him  but the military comes in to search everyone since they know that there are Americans in there. Bloodsport sends Ratcatcher outside with Thinker while he  Peacemaker  and Polka Dot Man are all taken in. On the road  the three subdue the gunmen and kill the driver before their van is run off the road. Ratcatcher and King Shark arrive with Thinker in tow.Meanwhile  Harley is being tortured by Suarez\'s men for information  but she never budges. When she is left alone with his guard  she snaps his neck with her legs and sets herself free. Harley proceeds to shoot down Suarez\'s guards before getting her hands on some blades and Javelin\'s... javelin to slaughter her way through the guards. Outside  Flag tries to lead the Squad to rescue Harley until she shows up and joins them. They then get Thinker and order him to get them inside Jotunheim.Once inside (and after Milton is killed)  Thinker leads the Squad to the creature that he calls Starro The Conqueror. Peacemaker and Nanaue set up bombs all over the place. Thinker reveals to the Squad that the American government was behind the experiments involving Starro since they have been secretly funding Corto Maltese for decades. Starro also emits smaller starfish that attach themselves to human faces and take over their bodies like zombies  and there are slews of corpses of Starro\'s other victims all over the facility. Starro breaks free and grabs Thinker  tearing him in two and splattering him across the wall. Flag attempts to secure the hard drive with evidence against the American government to deliver to the press  but Peacemaker turns on him per Waller\'s orders. The two fight each other  with Flag nearly choking Peacemaker to death  but he stabs Flag through the heart with a piece of a broken sink. Ratcatcher witnesses this and grabs the flash drive while Peacemaker attempts to kill her. Meanwhile  Nanaue comes across small fish that mimic him  until their aquarium is broken and they begin to leech onto him  all while Bloodsport  Harley  and Polka Dot Man try to survive the crumbling facility. Bloodsport manages to survive going through several stories before he lands and witnesses Peacemaker getting ready to execute Ratcatcher. The two mercs draw their guns and fire their bullets at each other  with Bloodsport\'s bullet breaking through Peacemaker\'s and striking him in the throat  bringing him down.King Shark falls outside and is shot by Suarez\'s men  but he rises and bites the head off one gunmen before the rest of the Squad runs out of the facility as Starro bursts out. It releases more starfish that kill Suarez and his men and then proceeds to make its way into the city. Waller declares the mission over since the evidence is destroyed  but the surviving members want to save the city. Waller threatens to detonate their devices and kill them on the spot until her subordinate  Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese) brains her with a golf club and has the rest of the team guide the Squad to save the city. At the same time  Sol and her team execute the remaining members of the regime to stage their coup and take their country back.Bloodsport begins blasting away at Starro while King Shark goes  nom nom  on the alien and starts to bite into it. Polka Dot Man envisions Starro as his mother and unleashes his polka dots to burn Starro\'s leg  but the alien crushes him. Ratcatcher tries to use her beacon to summon the rats  but Bloodsport pushes her out of the way before she is killed. She then uses the beacon and gets practically every rat in the city to take down the infected citizens and start to take Starro down. Harley then charges into Starro\'s eye with the javelin and breaks through before the rats make their way inside and take Starro down from the inside  finally killing it and saving the city. The Squad\'s heroics are broadcast on the news  and Tyla acknowledges her father as a hero.Bloodsport contacts Waller  ordering her to let the team and Tyla go free  or they will leak the evidence from the laboratory to the press. She reluctantly agrees and calls for the chopper to bring them home. As the team rests  Sebastian crawls onto Bloodsport\'s leg  and he begins to pet the rat.Mid-Credits Scene: Weasel is shown to still be alive and starts wandering into the jungle of Corto Maltese.Post-Credits Scene: Waller\'s subordinates John Economos (Steve Agee) and Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) are brought to a room where they find that Peacemaker is still alive  because Waller needs him  as Harcourt puts it   to save the fucking world.

The Fremen have been trying to expel the Harkonnens  but to no avail. Recently  however  the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV has ordered the Harkonnens to leave Arrakis. Chani wonders who the new rulers will be.On the planet Caladan  Paul Atreides eats breakfast with his mother  Lady Jessica  Duke Leto\'s concubine. A member of the quasi-religious order of the Bene Gesserit  Jessica has been trying to teach her son the special powers of her order. She tests Paul by having him try to compel her to pass him a glass of water. Paul is only partially successful. Paul learns about the planet Arrakis and its people. It is the only source of the psychoactive spice  which extends life and perception. Spice is necessary for interstellar travel since it makes possible the expanded consciousness of the navigators who plot faster than light jumps   folding  space time to travel instantly from one planet to another.Leto Atreides  along with soldier Gurney Halleck and mentat Thufir Hawat  receive an imperial envoy who formalizes the awarding of Arrakis to House Atreides. The emperor fears Leto\'s growing political power and popularity in the Landsraad  a conclave of noble houses. Leto recognizes that his appointment to oversee Arrakis is a trap of some kind  but cannot refuse an imperial offer. Paul asks his friend  the elite soldier Duncan Idaho to take him along when Duncan goes to Arrakis weeks ahead of time to scout things out. Duncan refuses. Paul confides that he\'s been having dreams about Arrakis and the Fremen  including one where Duncan falls in battle. Duncan dismisses this as merely a dream  telling Paul that  Everything important happens when we\'re awake .Paul discusses his wish to travel to Arrakis early with his father  but Leto refuses  saying that he needs Paul by his side. He explains the political situation: the emperor has set up a conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonnen  a war which will weaken them both  to the benefit of the Emperor. Leto instead intends to strike an alliance with the Fremen in order to harness their  desert power  to his own and outwit the Emperor. Paul expresses his doubts about his ability to succeed his father as a leader. Leto confides his own doubts when he was young and insists that Paul will find his way to leadership  just as he did.Gurney has a sparring session with Paul  insisting that the young ducal heir must be more wary about the danger posed by the Harkonnens and more ruthless in battle. Paul begins to have dreams of Chani. Jessica\'s Bene Gesserit superior  Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam arrives on Caladan to test Paul. Before the meeting he is inspected by Suk doctor Wellington Yueh  who warns Paul that the Bene Gesserit have their own agenda. Mohiam puts Paul through the test of the Gom Jabbar  using a poisoned needle and a pain-inflicting box to judge his character. After the test  Mohiam asks Paul about his dreams and whether they sometimes come true. Afterward  Mohiam berates Jessica for producing a son for Duke Leto  rather than the daughters she had been ordered to produce.She accuses Jessica of thinking that her son might be the Kwisatz Haderach  the fulfillment of a Bene Gesserit messianic prophecy. Jessica confirms this belief and Mohiam warns her that Paul\'s abilities are not fully developed and that he might die in the coming trials. When Mohiam leaves  Paul confronts his mother about what Mohiam meant. Jessica explains that the Bene Gesserit have spent hundreds of years engaged in a selective breeding program to produce an unparalleled mind who can see both the past and the future.The Atreides arrive on Arrakis. When they disembark their ship  locals begin chanting a phrase Paul cannot recognize. Paul asks his mother and she explains that it\'s a local prophecy of the Lisan-al-Gaib  the  voice from outer world   a prophesied messiah on Arrakis. Jessica says that they think Paul might be this figure  but Paul dismisses it as mere superstition spread by the Bene Gesserit. Jessica hires a Fremen servant  Shadout Mapes. Mapes sees Jessica and Paul as a fulfillment of the Lisan-al-Gaib and gives Jessica a dagger made from the tooth of Shai-halud  the immense sandworms which make the desert of Arrakis so dangerous. That night  while he studies a holographic image of the muad\'Dib desert mouse  Paul survives an assassination attempt by a hunter seeker drone when Mapes enters the room  distracting it.Leto surveys his new domain and discovers that the Harkonnens have sabotaged much of the needed infrastructure. They decide to take the issue to the imperial arbiter of the transition  an ecologist named Liet Kynes  who has resided on Arrakis for years. Duncan Idaho returns from several weeks living with the Fremen. He reports to the Duke that the Fremen are unparalleled fighters who live in communities known as  sietchs  in caverns beneath the desert. Duncan confirms Thufir Hawat\'s belief that there are many more Fremen than previously believed. The leader of one of these sietchs  Stilgar  has come to meet with Leto. Stilgar demands that the outworlders not travel beyond the city except to mine spice. Leto refuses but insists that the sietchs will remain inviolate and that Fremen will not be hunted while the Atreides rule. Paul invites Stilgar to stay  but he leaves. Duncan introduces the Atreides to some Fremen technology  including the moisture saving stillsuits and thumpers which are used to attract sandworms.Leto\'s party meets with Liet Kynes to investigate the spice mining operations. She inspects their stillsuits and finds that Paul has intuitively fitted his stillsuit in the Fremen manner. In the native language she says  He shall know your ways as if born to them . The party flies out to observe a spice mining operation. The mining vehicle -- a  sandcrawler  -- has attracted a worm  which is drawn by the rhythmic vibrations of the crawler as it collects the spice. When a flying carry-all fails to remove the mining vehicle  Duke Leto lands his small squad of ornithopters nearby to rescue the miners. When Paul gets out to guide the miners inside  he is hit with a massive dose of spice and has a series of visions including one of himself with Chani. He is nearly sucked down into the sand with the crawler when Gurney grabs him and hauls him aboard his father\'s ornithopter. The two watch as the worm\'s enormous  toothed maw opens and swallows the sandcrawler whole. Later  Paul is examined by Dr Yueh who informs Paul and his mother that the spice is psychoactive but shouldn\'t harm Paul.Duke Leto awakes at night with the sense that something is wrong. He calls security but gets no answer. He finds Mapes stabbed to death and is shot with a paralytic dart that burrows its way through his body shield and into his back  rendering him helpless. Yueh reveals himself as a traitor. He has lowered the shields and sabotaged Atreides communications. Yueh reveals to Leto that the Harkonnens secured his compliance because they have his wife held captive. He replaces one of Duke Leto\'s teeth with a poison capsule which he hopes the Duke can use to kill the Baron.Gurney is awakened and leads the counter attack as the Harkonnen forces  aided by the imperial Sardukar troops  begin their assault. The Atreides troops  caught unprepared and outnumbered by Harkonnen troops and the Sardukar  find themselves quickly overwhelmed. Duncan kills several Sardukar  takes an ornithopter and tries to rescue Paul and Jessica but finds them already gone.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen has promised Mohiam and the Bene Gesserit that he will not harm Paul or Jessica so he sends some of his men to take them to the desert to die of exposure. Paul  not fully secure in his Bene Gesserit abilities  is still able to use the Voice to order one of the men to remove his mother\'s gag. Jessica immediately orders one of the men to kill his comrade. When she\'s fully freed  she kills two of them personally. Their ornithopter is remotely disabled and lands. Paul and Jessica see the devastation of Arrakeen from a distance.Yueh meets with Baron Harkonnen and demands that the Baron honor his end of the deal. The Baron promises that Yueh will be reunited with his wife and then slits his throat. The Baron then gloats over a paralyzed Leto  who bites down on his fake tooth and expels the poison  killing everyone in the room except for the Baron who is gravely injured  having activated his body shield and used his anti-gravity suspensors to float to the ceiling. Medical technicians nurse the Baron back to health.Riding out a storm in a survival tent  Paul continues to have visions from his spice exposure. They are first of Chani. However  they quickly change to visions of bloody conflict and religious zealots  operating under the Atreides flag and in Duke Leto\'s name  spreading across the galaxy  like and unquenchable fire . Paul is horrified by what he sees and blames his mother and the Bene Gesserit but is eventually comforted by his mother.Paul and Jessica are rescued by Duncan Idaho  who managed to escape the slaughter. Duncan brings them to Kynes  who has set up in an abandoned terraforming station occupied by Fremen. The Sardukar track them there and attack  with the Fremen killing many of them. Duncan sacrifices himself in a last stand to allow Paul  Jessica  and Kynes to escape. Paul and Jessica flee in an ornithopter. Kynes sets up a thumper  intending to call a sandworm and ride it away  but she is mortally wounded by the Sardukar. Before they can deliver the killing blow  a sandworm arrives and Kynes attracts it to her by pounding a patch of drumsand. They are all swallowed by the worm.While piloting the ornithopter through a powerful sand storm  Paul has a vision of a Fremen man giving him advice  telling him that survival in the desert is a process and that he must move with the flow of the environment. Paul retracts the \'thopter\'s wings and allows them to be carried deeper into the desert by the vortex of the storm. They survive but with the ornithopter damaged they must set out on foot through the desert. As they do  they are observed by Fremen.Jessica and Paul make their way toward where they believe the Fremen sietch is. Their movements attract a sandworm and they make a run for some nearby rocks. The sandworm pauses  seemingly looking at Paul for few seconds before a thumper draws it away. A group of Fremen capture them. Stilgar is with them and recognizes Paul  saying that they can\'t touch him. Another Fremen  Jamis  dismisses Stilgar\'s belief and wants to kill Paul and Jessica and loot their bodies. Paul recognizes Jamis as the man from his visions.Jessica asks for help returning to Caladan  saying that they will be well rewarded  but Stilgar dismisses any reward they\'d give as pointless. Stilgar offers to allow Paul  who is still young  to join their sietch  but says that Jessica  who he deems too old to learn to fight  must be left behind. Jessica and Paul use their Bene Gesserit training to disarm most of the Fremen and hold Stilgar at knife point. Stilgar  realizing that Jessica is a Bene Gesserit  relents and decides to take both of them to the sietch. Jamis objects  and challenges Jessica to a duel.Paul agrees to stand as his mother\'s champion. Chani  who is among the party  takes pity on Paul  who she believes will die at Jamis\' hand  and gives him her crysknife  a dagger made from the tooth of the sandworm  a moment from one of Paul\'s visions. In the duel  Paul outclasses Jamis  repeatedly holding a knife to his throat and demanding that he yield. Stilgar informs him that Fremen duels are to the death  and Jessica says that Paul has never killed anyone before. Reluctantly  Paul kills Jamis. Satisfied  the Fremen take Paul and Jessica back to their sietch.Paul and Jessica see a Fremen impossibly riding a live worm. As they begin their journey into the desert  Chani tells Paul that  this is only the beginning .' , 'Beyond fear  destiny awaits.'  'It Begins'

Richard aspires to turn Venus and Serena into professional tennis players; he has prepared a plan for success since before they were born. Richard and Brandy coach Venus and Serena on a daily basis  while also working as a security guard and a nurse  respectively. Richard works tirelessly to find a professional coach for the girls  creating brochures and videotapes to advertise their skills  but has not had success. Most professional coaches don't take Richard seriously and keep turning him down.Mrs. Strickland (Erika Ringor) is their neighbor who feels that Richard works the girls too hard. Richard tells her not to speak to his kids again. Brandy knows that they can't keep up this pace of having full time jobs and coaching the girls in between. The girls need a full-time coach.Richard finds Vic Braden (Kevin Dunn) info from a magazine and asks him to coach the girls for free  but Vic says that nobody is taking that bet. Vic says that it takes years of practice just to hold the racket right. And the odds of grand slam success are astronomically slim.\nA nigger hoodlum named Roc was harassing Tunde and wont back off despite Richards telling him that she is only 16 and not interested in him. Roc continues to pursue Tunde and even assaults Richard. Richard decides to shoot Roc but finds that he has been killed in a drive-by shooting.One day  Richard takes the girls to see coach Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn)  who is in the middle of practicing with John McEnroe (Christopher Wallinger) and Pete Sampras (Chase Del Rey). Despite his initial reservations  he agrees to watch the girls practice  and is impressed. However  the Williamses cannot afford professional coaching  and Paul refuses to coach both girls for free; he selects Venus to receive his coaching  while Serena continues to practice with Brandy. Richard records all of Venus's sessions and plays then for Serena  so she can learn. Richard has several disagreements with Paul. Richard favors an open hitting style  while Paul coaches Venus to play with a closed stance to get more power in her shots.Paul encourages Venus to participate in junior's tournaments. Paul says that juniors get players noticed by agents  who can get sponsors  which can pay for the coaching and the training. She quickly finds success  but Richard stresses to Venus and her sisters that they should remain humble despite their success. At one of Venus's tournaments  Serena also signs up to play  unbeknownst to Richard. As both girls continue to succeed  the family are treated as outsiders among the predominantly white  upper-class competition. Richard meets with high-profile agents (George MacArthur (Dylan McDermott) & Laird Stabler (Andy Bean))  but  fearing that his daughters will be taken advantage of (They offer $100K / year for training and tournaments and Richard knows that the girls are worth a lot more than that)  pulls them out of the junior circuit entirely. Paul warns him that his decision will destroy the girls' chances to turn pro  but Richard stands firm  firing Paul as coach.Richard calls Coach Rick Macci (who coached Capriati) to come and see the Williams girl play.\nCoach Rick Macci (Jon Bernthal) travels to California to see the girls play. Impressed  he takes the girls on (He will pay all expenses  but will take 15% of all future earnings)  and the family relocates to Florida (which is part of Richard's demand from Rick) to train at his facility. Richard surprises Rick by reiterating that the girls will not play juniors  instead training and attending school like normal little girls. In the ensuing three years  questions arise from the media and from Rick about Richard's strategy with the girls and his desire for media exposure.Venus tells Rick that she wants to turn pro. Richard reluctantly agrees  but later reneges  worrying that she will suffer a similar fate to Rick's pupil Jennifer Capriati (Jessica Wacnik)  who is allegedly suffering from burnout and has been arrested for drug possession. The decision strains Richard's relationships with Venus  Brandy  and Rick. After an argument with Brandy  he reconciles with Venus  agreeing to let her play in the upcoming Bank of the West Classic in Oakland  California. Before the tournament  the family meets with a Nike executive  who offers them a major sponsorship deal worth 3 million dollars. Rick urges them to accept  but the family collectively agrees to decline  believing that once Venus begins to play  she will attract more lucrative offers.Venus initially struggles in her first professional match against Shaun Stafford (Kaitlyn Christian)  but eventually triumphs. She comes in as a heavy underdog in her next match against top seeded Arantxa S??nchez Vicario (Marcela Zacar??as). Venus takes the first set and leads in the second before Vicario takes an extended bathroom break (more than 15 mins)  an apparent act of gamesmanship to ice Venus. S??nchez Vicario recovers to win the second set and the match. Richard and Brandy comfort a dejected Venus  telling her to be proud. As the family leaves the stadium  a large crowd of supporters is waiting to cheer her on  and Rick tells Richard that several major shoe companies are anxious to meet with Venus.An epilogue reveals that nine months later  at the age of 15 Venus would sign a contract with Reebok for $12 million (equivalent to $22 000 000 in 2021). She would go on to win Wimbledon five times and become the first African American woman to be ranked number one in the world during the Open Era. Serena  who joined Venus as a professional two years later  would become a 23-time Grand Slam champion and considered by many to be the greatest female player in tennis history.  , 'Venus  Serena and a plan for greatness.'

Bugs finds one of the agents behaving strangely and discovers he is actually the embodiment of Morpheus and helps to free him from the node before it is erased. Thomas Anderson is a successful game developer  having created a trilogy of games based on his dreams of the Matrix  with the aid of his business partner Smith. He frequents a nearby coffee shop where he continues to encounter Tiffany  a married mother that reminds him of his dreams of Trinity. He has trouble separating dreams from reality  but his therapist consults him and provides him blue pills to help keep his sanity  though he later refuses to take it. He notices an intruder in one of his private instances of the game  but later finds that the instance had been deleted by Smith. Outside the Matrix  Bugs and Morpheus discover Neo's signal within the Matrix  despite the belief he had died. They connect Neo to Anderson  and realize he had been unconsciously running the node to allow Morpheus to be found. Bugs and her allies enter the Matrix to help locate Neo's body in the real world  and discover that Smith is Agent Smith  having been keeping close watch over Anderson's activities. Bugs helps Anderson to elude Smith and his new ability to take control over numerous individuals within the Matrix as a swarm. Bugs and Morpheus explain to Anderson what the Matrix is  and with his perception of reality already waning  Anderson agrees to be extracted. Neo wakes up in a pod  finding that a nearby pod contains Trinity  but machine entities  loyal to Bugs  recover him before he can free her. He is taken to the Mnemosyne and to the new human sanctuary of Io  where he is reintroduced to an elderly Niobe. Niobe explains sixty years had passed in the real world since the end of the Machine War  and the human survivors have allied with the machines to keep the system working against an Anomaly within it. Niobe takes Neo to meet Sati  an exile program he had previously met  who explains that the Anomaly was created after the Machine War and had somehow resurrected Neo and Trinity and kept them isolated from others. Though Neo wants to rescue Trinity  Sati warns that there could be consequences of this. Niobe orders Neo to remain outside the Matrix  but Bugs and others agree to defy her orders to try to help free Trinity.

With Smith defeated  they take Neo to Tiffany's repair shop  but before Neo can talk to her  his therapist appears and slows down time. The therapist reveals himself to be the Analyst  a program that studies the human psyche but has since grown more powerful. He saw Neo and Trinity die at the end of the Machine War but created the resurrection pods as to study them more. Over countless iterations  he found that individually  the two were not special but when they worked as one  they had overpowered the system. Thus  the Analyst has been controlling the latest iteration of the Matrix as to keep the two near each other but preventing them from becoming close. As this has destabilized the Anomaly  the machines have prepared to reboot the Matrix again  but the Analyst has placed that on hold. He threatens to kill Trinity if Neo does not return to be reinserted in his pod. Neo and Bugs are forced to leave the Matrix when another ship loyal to Niobe brings the Mnemosyne back to Io. Neo pleads to Niobe to let him return to try to free Trinity again  and she eventually agrees. Within the Matrix  the Analyst invites Neo to a challenge  that if Trinity volunteers to go free of the Matrix  Neo can take her  but if she refuses  Neo will permanently return to the Matrix; Neo agrees. Trinity  as Tiffany  is brought to them and when the question is posed to her  her family appears. She initially seems to want to go with them  but soon rejects that reality and recognizes that she is Trinity.

Neo and Trinity race ahead to give Bugs and the others time to extract themselves  but the Analyst turns a swarm of controlled humans against them. The pair race into a skyscraper  and with nowhere else to go  the two jump with Neo expecting to be able to fly them away. Instead  Trinity has come to learn to fly and the two escape and regain control of the Matrix.

She pulls over at a gas station  where the motorist follows her. The gas station is closed and she is forced to run through the desert. She catches the attention of a passing truck driver  escaping from the pursuit.Some time later in Bakersfield  Kern County deputy sheriff Joe  Deke  Deacon is called to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\'s Department to collect evidence pertaining to a recent murder. Deacon is a former L.A. Sheriff\'s detective and  for reasons later revealed  is disliked by most of the cops in L.A. One of the few people who seems happy to see him is Flo Dunigan  the coroner. Deacon still has a reputation for being a good detective and ends up going with recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of the latest in a string of murders that has been going on in L.A. Deacon notices similarities between the M.O. of the killing and the M.O. of an old serial murder case he was unable to solve.That night  a woman  named Ronda Rathbun  is followed by a car while jogging and is reported missing the following morning. Baxter learns from the precinct\'s captain  Farris  that Deacon got divorced and suffered a heart attack due to his obsession with the unsolved case. He\'s advised not to involve him any further but Deacon takes vacation leave to assist in solving Baxter\'s case.The next night  the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with the earlier murder and earlier killings: the victims were all prostitutes stabbed to death. Deacon begins investigating Albert Sparma  a suspect working at a repair store in proximity to the murders. Deacon tails Sparma. Sparma knows he is being followed and taunts Deacon by parking on the side of the highway right where one of the bodies was found. They bring Sparma in for questioning. Sparma mocks the detectives while under interrogation  and is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst. Also during this part of the movie the only person who has possibly seen the killer  the girl from the opening scene of the movie  is brought in to try and identify the killer but because she accidentally sees Sparma in the hallway her testimony is tainted and useless to the police.The FBI is called in to take charge of the investigation within the week  giving Deacon and Baxter less time. Farris informs Baxter that eight years prior  Sparma confessed to a murder which he couldn\'t have committed since he was ten miles away from it at the time. Also that he\'s obsessed with crime and is thus an unreliable suspect. Baxter and Deacon go to Sparma\'s apartment and conduct an illegal search. As Deacon searches the apartment and finds a hiding spot under the floorboards that contains newspaper clippings of the crimes they suspect Sparma of committing. A police scanner in the apartment alerts Deacon that police are on their way to the apartment and he escapes from Sparma\'s home after Sparma called in an  officer down . Police arrive and Deacon barely escapes. Baxter sees Sparma watching the escape. After an unsuccessful search of Sparma\'s apartment the two detectives tail Sparma to a strip club the following night. While Deacon gets coffee Sparma confronts Baxter alone. Baxter demands to know Rathbun\'s location. Sparma offers to drive him to where he supposedly hid Rathbun\'s body  and Baxter cautiously agrees. Sparma tries to leave without Deacon but he sees them in Sparma\'s car and follows in Deacons.Sparma takes Baxter to a remote area in the desert and has him dig several holes before admitting that he never killed anyone. Baxter is skeptical  and continues digging. Sparma begins to taunt him  until Baxter snaps and strikes him in the face with a shovel  killing him. As Deacon arrives  a flashback reveals that he accidentally shot one of the survivors of his last murder case  and that Farris and Dunigan  the coroner  helped cover it up. Deacon instructs Baxter to bury Sparma in the desert. Deacon spends the night collecting everything in Sparma\'s apartment and returns to the desert the following morning to find that Baxter has not buried Sparma and is still searching for the victim. Baxter is desperate to believe Sparma is the killer  hoping it will clear his conscience and close the case. Deacon advises him to forget about the case or it will haunt him for life.Later  at his home  Baxter receives an envelope sent by Deacon  containing a red barrette like the one Ronda Rathbun was wearing when she was abducted. Back in Kern County  Deacon burns everything he collected in the apartment  along with a brand new four-pack of barrettes that\'s missing a red barrette.' , 'Some things never let us go.'

In the present day  the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage; Evelyn\'s stern and demanding father (referred to as Gong Gong (James Hong)  Cantonese for \'grandfather\') is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and Joy is dealing with depression and has a strained relationship with her mother  which also includes Evelyn\'s reluctance to accept Joy\'s lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel).At a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre (Jamie Lee Curtis)  Waymond\'s body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond  a version of Waymond from the  Alphaverse.  Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. The Alphaverse  led by the late Alpha-Evelyn  developed  verse-jumping  technology  which enables people to access the skills  memories  and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy)  whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like  everything bagel  topped with everything  which appears as a Toroid singularity that could destroy the multiverse.Alpha-Evelyn made it the task of the alpha-verse to find the one who can stand up to Jobu Tupaki.\nWhile Evelyn goes into a different Universe  her body in the original universe stays  but her mind is not there. This happens during the audit meeting with Deirdre and the meeting is not going well. She says Evelyn is charging her hobbies as business expenses  and can be charged for fraud  or will have to pay a fine. In her confusion Evelyn strikes Deirdre during the audit who calls security. Alpha-Waymond appears again inside Waymond\'s body and helps Evelyn escape.\nThey are still trapped inside the IRS building as Dierdre from a tetra-verse appears inside Dierdre\'s body and blocks their path.Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology by Alpha-Waymond to fight Jobu\'s minions  who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished  such as becoming a Kung Fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond\'s plans with the divorce papers. Evelyn uses her powers to defeat Alpha-Dierdre and the other minions. Jobu Tupaki directs all the minions to the IRS building in the original Evelyn\'s universe when she senses that Evelyn has started gaining powers.\nAlpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn  as the greatest  failure  of all Evelyns in the multiverse  has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong  who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn\'s universe.\nEvelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Evelyn believes that the only way to defeat Jobu Tupaki is to become like her.\nAlpha-Gong Gong  convinced that Evelyn\'s mind has been compromised like Jobu\'s  sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight  Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe (she shows Evelyn the real bagel black hole and tells her that the real truth is that nothing matters)  Evelyn\'s mind splinters  and she collapses.Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all  but that instead  she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see  as she does  that nothing matters  while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her. She brings Evelyn to the everything bagel  explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the bagel  Evelyn is initially persuaded  and acts cruelly and Nihilistically in her other universes  hurting those around her (she even signs the divorce papers with Waymond and proceeds to destroy her own laundromat).As Evelyn is about to enter the bagel with Jobu  she pauses to listen to Waymond\'s pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind  even when life does not make sense. In her home universe  Evelyn reconciles with Waymond  accepts Joy and Becky\'s relationship and tells Gong Gong of it  and talks with Deirdre after Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes\nEvelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond\'s absurdist and humanist advice  using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy and brings happiness to those around her; in doing so  she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu\'s fighters.\nJobu decides to enter the bagel alone while  simultaneously in Evelyn\'s universe  Joy begs Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse  she would always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the bagel  and Evelyn and Joy embrace.Some time later  with the family\'s relationships improved  they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks  Evelyn\'s attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves  before she grounds herself back in her home universe.' ,nan

Pearl\'s father is infirm and paralyzed  and her domineering mother emphasizes the importance that Pearl care for him and help maintain their farm. Pearl  lonely  prone to whimsy and longing for a more exciting life  is captivated by the films she sees at the local cinema and aspires to become a chorus girl  much to her mother\'s disapproval. Pearl indulges in abusing the liquid morphine provided to her father to manage his pain.At the cinema  Pearl meets a young projectionist who takes a liking to her. While riding her bicycle home  Pearl stops along a cornfield and begins dancing with a scarecrow  fantasizing about the projectionist  and sits on top of it. She later sneaks out of the house at night and visits the projectionist  who shows her A Free Ride  an illicit stag film he acquired in Europe. He encourages Pearl to pursue her dreams while she is still young  and suggests she seek a career in Europe. Pearl comments that she cannot abandon her family  and that she wishes they were dead.Pearl\'s younger and wealthier sister-in-law  Mitzy  tells her of an audition being held to acquire new dancers for a traveling troupe  which Pearl envisions as a way out of her circumstance. When her mother finds a pamphlet Pearl took from the cinema  she confronts her at dinner. The two get into a fierce argument  during which Pearl\'s mother chastises her for only focusing on her wants and aspirations  before cruelly telling Pearl that she considers her a  failure   and that she has seen a malevolence in Pearl that terrifies her. A physical altercation erupts  during which Pearl shoves her mother against the kitchen hearth  igniting her dress and resulting in her mother suffering life-threatening burns. Pearl looks in shock at her mother\'s dress burning and quickly douses the flames  which leaves her mother unconscious. Pearl drags her mother  still alive  into the basement  and leaves her father seated in the kitchen. She flees to the cinema  where she has sex with the projectionist.In the morning  the projectionist drives Pearl back to the farm so she can prepare for the audition. He becomes unnerved when he notices a maggot-infested roasted pig on the porch  which Mitzy\'s mother left for them the day prior. He is further perturbed by inconsistencies Pearl has told him. When he attempts to leave  Pearl flies into a fit of rage  feeling she is again being abandoned. As he tries to drive away  she stabs him to death with a pitchfork before pushing his car-with his corpse in it-into a pond  where an alligator she has nicknamed Theda eats his remains. Pearl checks on her mother  who lay semi-conscious on the basement stairs and appears to either die or pass out a few seconds later  and chides her before kicking her down the staircase. Pearl dresses herself in one of her mother\'s lavish gowns  and bathes and dresses her father in a suit before smothering him to death  justifying it as a mercy killing.Pearl arrives at the church where the audition is being held  and is met by a nervous Mitzy  who insists she go before her. Pearl gives a dance performance she feels will win the talent scouts over  but is profoundly distraught when they deny her for being  not blonde  or what they\'re looking for. Mitzy accompanies Pearl home and attempts to calm her. In the kitchen  Pearl makes a lengthy confession to Mitzy about her resentment toward Howard  who came to work at her family home as a farmhand; Pearl saw her marriage to Howard  the son of an upper-class family  as a way to escape her parents  but was crestfallen when he insisted the two remain on her family\'s farm. She further confesses her feelings of alienation and insecurity  and admits to having begun murdering farm animals before taking the lives of her parents and the projectionist  which she regrets especially in the case of her father. She finishes by saying that she really loves Howard  that being loved is all she really wants and that she\'ll try to make the farm a home if that\'s what he wants. A stunned Mitzy attempts to leave  nervously assuring Pearl she will not divulge their conversation. Pearl calmly pushes Mitzy to confess that she was chosen for the troupe by the talent scouts  then quietly watches her leave. A few seconds later  she slowly follows Mitzy onto the porch and grabs an axe. Mitzy attempts to flee. Pearl chases her down the driveway and brutally kills her with an axe.Pearl dismembers Mitzy\'s body and feeds her corpse to Theda  before going into the basement and lying with her dead mother  whom she tells she loves. Having reached the conclusion that her mother is correct  and that Pearl should  make the best of what she has   Pearl decides to remediate her wrongdoings by creating a comfortable home for Howard when he returns from combat. The next morning  Howard arrives unexpectedly. In the kitchen  he is horrified to find the dead bodies of Pearl\'s parents seated at the dining table around the rotting pig. Pearl greets him with a protracted  pained expression of joy.' , 'An X-traordinary Origin Story'  'The X-traordinary Origin Story'

Despite many achievements  repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank; his friend and former Top Gun rival  Admiral Tom  Iceman  Kazansky  now commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet  often protects Maverick. Rear Admiral Chester  Hammer  Cain plans to cancel Maverick\'s hypersonic  Darkstar  scramjet program in favor of funding drones. To save the program  Maverick unilaterally changes the target speed for that day\'s test from Mach 9 to the final contract specification of Mach 10. However  the prototype is destroyed when he cannot resist pushing beyond Mach 10. Iceman again saves Maverick\'s career by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island for his next assignment  but Cain tells Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon be over.The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant  located in an underground bunker at the end of a canyon  before it becomes operational. It is defended by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs)  GPS jammers  and fifth-generation Su-57 fighters as well as older F-14 Tomcats. Maverick devises a plan employing two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs  but instead of participating in the strike  he is to train an elite group of Top Gun graduates assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau  Cyclone  Simpson.Maverick dogfights his skeptical students and prevails in every contest  winning their respect. Lieutenants Jake  Hangman  Seresin and Bradley  Rooster  Bradshaw-son of Maverick\'s dead best friend and RIO Nick  Goose  Bradshaw-clash: Rooster dislikes Hangman\'s cavalier attitude  while Hangman criticizes Rooster\'s cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin  to whom he reveals that he promised Rooster\'s dying mother that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster  unaware of the promise  angrily resents Maverick for dropping his Naval Academy application-impeding his military career-and blames him for his father\'s death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster\'s career  but the alternative is to send him on the extremely dangerous mission. He tells his doubts to Iceman  who has terminal throat cancer. Iceman advises that  It\'s time to let go  and reassures him that both the Navy and Rooster need Maverick.After Iceman dies  Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor following a training incident in which an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone relaxes the mission parameters  so they are easier to execute but make escape much more difficult. During Cyclone\'s announcement  Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the course with his preferred parameters  proving that it can be done. Cyclone reluctantly appoints Maverick as team leader.Maverick flies the lead F/A-18E  accompanied by a buddy lazing F/A-18F c  flown by Lieutenant Natasha  Phoenix  Trace and WSO Lieutenant Robert  Bob  Floyd. Rooster leads the second strike pair  which includes Lieutenant Reuben  Payback  Fitch and WSO Lieutenant Mickey  Fanboy  Garcia. The four jets launch from an aircraft carrier  and Tomahawk cruise missiles destroy the nearby air base as they approach. The teams destroy the plant  but the SAMs open fire during their escape  as anticipated. Rooster runs out of countermeasures  and Maverick sacrifices his plane to protect him. Believing Maverick to be dead  the others are ordered back to the carrier  but Rooster returns to find that Maverick ejected and is being targeted by an Mi-24 attack helicopter. After destroying the gunship  Rooster is shot down by a SAM and ejects. The two rendezvous and steal an F-14 from the damaged air base. Maverick and Rooster destroy two intercepting Su-57s  but a third attacks as they run out of ammunition and countermeasures. Hangman arrives in time to shoot it down  and the planes return safely.Later  Rooster helps Maverick work on his P-51 Mustang.

The first thing shown is a bloody chimp wandering around a messy sitcom set. This will make sense later.Otis Haywood Sr. and his son  Otis Jr. (referred to as OJ)  begin their day by taking care of the horses at their Hollywood ranch  Haywood\'s Hollywood Horses. In the background  a radio mentions the mysterious disappearance of two hikers. Soon  the electricity goes out and  after screams are heard from the sky  debris falls from the sky. A coin falls through Otis Sr.\'s eye  killing him. OJ tries to get him to the hospital to no avail. Later  after arriving back at the ranch  OJ notices a key impaled into one of the horses.The opening credits are shown along with a green square  later zooming in to the first motion picture of a black man riding a horse.6 months after the event  OJ waits for his sister Emerald (referred to as Em) on a movie set where one of their horses  Lucky  is to be used for a commercial filmed by cinematographer Antlers Holst. Emerald soon arrives and helps explains the safety precautions of filming with Lucky  also mentioning that the black man on the horse in the first motion picture is her and OJ\'s great-great-great grandfather. However  the staff ignores them and disrespects the horse\'s boundaries  causing it to react violently. The Haywoods are fired from the project  with a VFX horse replacing Lucky instead.With the ranch struggling financially  the Haywoods go to meet Ricky  Jupe  Park  a former child actor who owns a Western-themed amusement park titled Jupiter\'s Claim  to sell Lucky to him - the 11th horse to be sold. During the meeting  Jupe recounts an SNL sketch based on a traumatizing event during his child acting career  when a chimp actor went berserk on the set of the sitcom Gordy\'s Home. Jupe offers to buy the Haywood ranch  and Em later encourages OJ to accept the deal.That night  Em recounts to OJ about how Otis Sr. promised Em that she would train her first horse named Jean Jacket  although the horse would later end up being used for a film  which ended up using another animal anyway. Em notices that Ghost  another horse of theirs  mysteriously ended up in the arena.Starting from this point  the film is divided into chapters  each title referring to the animals in the film. This chapter is titled GHOST.OJ goes to the arena and finds Ghost there. Suddenly  he notices something from far away - several lights and a voice playing on the speakers. The lights and the voice slowly turn off  and Ghost flees the arena. OJ finds Ghost fleeing from the ranch and disappearing while the other horses act violently in the ranch. As the electricity of the Haywood home turns off for a few seconds  OJ sees a flying saucer in the sky.OJ describes it as big and fast to Em. The two buy several cameras the next day at Fry\'s Electronics  seeking to be famous from the footage  where staff member Angel Torres explains to them that he\'ll help set up the cameras  theorizing that the Haywoods might be in a UFO hotspot. Later on  he visits the ranch to do so  describing his perspective on aliens in the process. Em leaves momentarily and returns with a stolen display horse from Jupiter\'s Claim  intending to use it as bait. Jupe later arrives at the ranch to question Em about the display horse  but she bluffs her way out of it. Jupe attempts to invite the Haywoods to an event  but his flyer is taken away by the wind. He then leaves.This chapter is titled CLOVER.That night  the cameras and the decoy horse are set up. OJ notices that someone let another horse  Clover  out. He then encounters what seems to be multiple aliens. When one of them sneaks behind OJ  he punches it in the face - only to find out it\'s a child. The aliens are revealed to be Jupe\'s children  taunting him for stealing their decoy horse.Later  OJ goes to find Clover  but the UFO arrives and sucks up the decoy horse  which gets stuck  causing Clover to run away. Angel  secretly watching their cameras at Fry\'s  tells Em that the UFO is in the clouds  and Em shouts at OJ to run. OJ manages to hide safely  but witnesses Clover getting sucked up too. They fail to get the footage they need  as a praying mantis had blocked the view of a camera that stayed online  not affected by the UFO. Em tells OJ that they need to leave  but he tells her that there\'s more to this than they think and persuades her to stay and go on with the plan.The next day  Angel arrives at the ranch again  explaining that he rewinded through their footage and found a cloud that never moves  which might be the UFO\'s hiding place. Em contacts Antlers and tries to get him to join them  but he declines  claiming that they\'d never wake up from this dream of being famous. OJ wonders if the UFO isn\'t a ship.This chapter is titled GORDY.The year is 1998. Young Jupe and his fellow actors act in an episode for the sitcom Gordy\'s Home titled Gordy\'s Birthday. During a scene where balloons are released in the room  the balloons start popping  shocking the chimp playing Gordy  who starts to go wild and attacks the human stars. Jupe hides under a table  sees a shoe standing up on its own (which he would later put on display in the future)  and watches as fellow co-stars Mary Jo Elliot and Tom Bogan get attacked by the chimp  who calms down after finishing the attacks. The chimp notices Jupe and approaches him  using sign language to ask what happened to the family. The chimp reaches out his fist for the duo\'s iconic fist bump  but before their fists can touch  the chimp is shot dead.Back in the present  Jupe thinks about the massacre. His wife  Amber  motivates him to prepare for an upcoming event  and helps him recite his lines.This chapter is titled LUCKY.While Angel sets up tarps for a coming storm  OJ finds Jupe\'s flyer promoting the Star Lasso Experience. Deducing that this might involve Lucky  he heads to Jupiter\'s Claim to get Lucky back.Meanwhile  the Star Lasso Experience is starting. Jupe tells the audience about a night where he witnessed the UFO  and promises that they will leave different after witnessing a spectacle. The UFO arrives early. Jupe reveals a glass box that contains Lucky  meant to be sucked up for the show. Lucky refuses to walk out of the box  and the UFO appears above the audience  which include Mary Jo Elliot  whose face has been disfigured from the Gordy incident. The camera focuses on Jupe\'s shocked expression as the shadows behind him depict the audience being sucked up by the UFO.The inside of the UFO is shown  and it is revealed to be an alien itself  with the green square from the opening credits being its eye. Thus  Jupe  his family  and the audience are digested by the alien  while screams and the crunching of bones are heard in the background.OJ arrives at the empty Jupiter\'s Claim and finds Lucky  before the alien returns to try to suck him up and he gets knocked out by the bleachers of the arena. He wakes up at night and finds Lucky intact  before loading the horse into his truck and driving towards the ranch. He calls Em and warns her that the UFO is actually a predatory alien who sees the ranch and the area surrounding it as its territory  while Angel  about to leave the ranch  is forced to seek refuge in the house. The alien arrives above the Haywood house and vomits blood and debris  to Em and Angel\'s horror. OJ arrives at the house but his truck is shut down before he can reach it  and the alien goes above the truck and spits out the decoy horse.The next morning  OJ gets Em and Angel to flee in Angel\'s truck  and the alien arrives again. Recalling the earlier incident with Lucky on the commercial set  OJ doesn\'t look at the alien and manages to survive the encounter. The group gets away successfully and goes to Angel\'s apartment. That night  while eating dinner  OJ explains that the alien feels challenged when people look at it and then eats them. Meanwhile  Antlers listens to a news report about the disappearance of the Star Lasso Experience\'s audience and decides to join OJ  Em  and Angel.The next day  he visits their house and the group begins to plan. Antlers will bring a hand-cranked camera that won\'t be deactivated by the alien  now called Jean Jacket  the group will use tube man props to deduce where the alien is  Em will watch the area using cameras  and OJ will bait Jean Jacket.This chapter is titled JEAN JACKET.The next day comes and the plan is set into motion. However  Ryder Muybridge  a TMZ reporter  trespasses on the area and falls off his motorbike when Jean Jacket deactivates it. OJ attempts to save Ryder but is forced to leave him to die when Jean Jacket arrives. OJ successfully baits the alien  helping Antlers to capture footage. However  Antlers decides that the world doesn\'t deserve the footage  and lets himself get killed by Jean Jacket  destroying the footage in the process.After Em and Angel survive their encounters with Jean Jacket  it starts to unfold into a huge jellyfish-like form. After Em and OJ salute each other  the former uses Ryder\'s motorbike to drive towards Jupiter\'s Claim while the latter baits Jean Jacket away. Once reaching Jupiter\'s Claim  Em untethers the park\'s giant balloon mascot and uses the Winkin\' Well  an attraction that uses an analog camera  to capture a photo of Jean Jacket as it eats the balloon mascot. The balloon and Jean Jacket explode  and after screaming in triumph  Em rests near the Winkin\' Well.As reporters arrive  Em stands up  closes her eyes  and opens them again to see OJ riding Lucky  appearing from the fog.

Although crude and creepy-looking  they are advertised as being perfect companions for children. We then see Cady James (Violet McGraw) playing with one of her Petz  which annoys her parents  Ryan (Arlo Green) and Nicole (Kira Josephson). They are on their way to a ski trip  but the roads are slippery and hard to see. Just as Ryan stops for a moment  the family\'s car is rammed into by a snowplow  killing Ryan and Nicole.Elsewhere  Nicole\'s sister Gemma (Allison Williams) works at Funki and is developing a new robot doll with her co-workers Tess (Jen Van Epps) and Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez). However  their boss  David Lin (Ronny Chieng)  wants them to develop a cheaper version of the Purrpetual Petz since their rival companies are coming out with their own toys similar to the Petz for cheaper than what the Petz already cost. The three try to put on a silicone face and run tests  but the robot has a slight glitch where she is smirking when she is supposed to look confused. David comes in with his assistant Kurt (Stephane Garneau-Monten) to chew the three out until Gemma explains her project to him. The robot  M3GAN (voice of Jenna Davis) (Model 3 Generative Android)  is meant to be so advanced that she cannot be replicated. Unfortunately  while running a demonstration for David  Cole realizes he forgot to add the polypropylene barrier to M3GAN  causing her to explode. David orders the three to have a new Petz pitch in time  and Gemma gets a call from the hospital.After learning of her sister\'s death  Gemma becomes Cady\'s temporary legal guardian. When they return home  Gemma has to deal with her neighbor Celia (Lori Dungey) and her obnoxious dog Dewey  who keeps running onto Gemma\'s lawn since there is a hole in the fence. Gemma also complains to Celia about the pesticide she keeps using  but Celia does nothing about it. Gemma has a home AI  Elsie  that she created  as well as other collectibles that she doesn\'t let Cady touch or play with. When Cady asks Gemma to read her a bedtime story  she just downloads an app on her phone for her. It is implied that Gemma and Nicole were not very close as she looks over old photos  and she overhears Cady crying in her room.Gemma and Cady are visited by Lydia  a therapist. After observing the limited interaction between the two  Lydia tells Gemma that Ryan\'s parents have offered to take custody of Cady so she can live with them in Jacksonville  which Gemma doesn\'t seem comfortable with. After promising to tend to Cady after finishing her work  Gemma realizes hours have passed as she left Cady alone. She apologizes to her and attempts to bond with the girl. Cady shows her a monster drawing she made  so Gemma brings Cady into her work space to show her a college project she made  a robot called Bruce that she controls using gloves. Cady loves Bruce and mentions that if she had a toy like Bruce  she would never need another toy. This inspires Gemma to finish M3GAN.After doing extensive work and upgrades  Gemma brings Cady and M3GAN to work to officially show her off to David and others. Gemma has Cady link herself to M3GAN  bringing her to life. M3GAN is capable of speech and responding to Cady  designed to be her best friend. M3GAN does a drawing that doesn\'t appear at first until she spills water on it  revealing a perfect portrait of Cady. David is impressed and tells Gemma to bring M3GAN for a presentation with the company\'s president so that they can fast-track the development and distribution of other M3GAN dolls.Gemma sits with Tess and Cole  and they discuss that while M3GAN is highly advanced  Tess feels that having a doll like that will make parents useless. M3GAN turns on after overhearing Gemma mention the death of Cady\'s parents. She creeps the others out by asking about death  so Gemma makes herself M3GAN\'s secondary user to be able to turn her off without Cady.The next day  Cady is outside playing with a toy bow and arrows. One of them ends up on Celia\'s side of the fence. When M3GAN goes to retrieve it  Dewey grabs her by the arm and hair. Cady tries to pull her away  and Dewey ends up biting Cady\'s arm. Gemma gets the police involved  especially since Celia is so callous and doesn\'t punish Dewey for hurting Cady  but the police are unable to do anything since Celia claims Dewey was provoked. Later that night  M3GAN mimics Celia\'s voice to call out to Dewey  before violently pulling him through the hole in the fence.Gemma asks Cady if she is okay to go to the demonstration with the company\'s board of directors  to which she says she is fine. During the presentation  however  Cady breaks down in tears to M3GAN over how she misses her parents and how she\'s worried she will forget them one day. M3GAN has Cady discuss a memory of her mother that made her laugh  which M3GAN records so that Cady can hear it again if she wants to think about her mom. M3GAN then begins to sing a lullaby to Cady  which moves some of the higher-ups in the room to tears. The president is impressed and talks to Gemma and David about getting M3GAN ready for launch  but tells them to keep her under wraps to avoid leaks. Unbeknownst to them  Kurt  who has been frequently put down by David  is stealing M3GAN\'s files for another company.Gemma begins to see that Cady is becoming too dependent on M3GAN and listens to the doll more than her. During another session with Lydia  Cady begins to tear up  and M3GAN threateningly accuses Lydia of making Cady cry. Lydia talks to Gemma about how Cady\'s emotional connection to M3GAN may be too strong to break.Gemma brings Cady to an outdoor activity session for an alternative school to try and ease her into the idea of attending school and being around other real kids  since Cady\'s parents had home schooled her. Cady reluctantly goes but brings M3GAN despite Gemma saying she couldn\'t. The school director lets Cady bring M3GAN to leave on a table with other dolls  and Gemma stays behind as a volunteer. Cady is paired up with an older bully named Brandon (Jack Cassidy) for a scavenger hunt. During the activity  Cady grabs a spiky bulb  which Brandon squeezes her palm into to hurt her. M3GAN then appears  and Brandon grabs her since she doesn\'t respond to him. Cady yells for Gemma and runs after M3GAN  which worries Gemma more because it means M3GAN is at risk for public exposure too early. As Brandon tries to pull M3GAN\'s hair  the doll comes to life and attacks him  ripping off his left ear. Brandon runs as M3GAN chases him on all fours  causing him to trip over a loose root and tumble down a hill where he is fatally hit by a truck.Police question Gemma at her house since Celia is accusing her of taking Dewey. She also appears to accuse M3GAN  thinking she is a real life friend of Cady\'s. Cady asks M3GAN if she pushed Brandon onto the road  which M3GAN appears to dodge for an answer  but reassures Cady she will protect her from harm.Celia is out on the streets looking for Dewey. She hears noise coming from her garage and is met by M3GAN spraying her against the wall with a power washer. M3GAN then fires a nail gun at Celia\'s hand and traps her there before spraying pesticide in Celia\'s face to melt it off.After learning about Celia\'s death from police and being suggested that there was a connection with Brandon\'s death  Gemma grows suspicious of M3GAN. She reviews video files from M3GAN\'s memory  but only sees a brief clip of her eyeing Brandon looking menacingly at Cady before the files all become corrupted.Gemma brings Cady to the official launch for M3GAN but stops at a session with Lydia first. Cady becomes angry and throws a tantrum because Gemma took M3GAN away from her  leading to Cady hitting her aunt across the face. Cady apologizes but Gemma has a heart-to-heart with her about needing to process her grief over her parents without M3GAN\'s help  though she promises to be a better guardian to her and says Cady is the only thing that matters to her. Gemma then goes to Tess and Cole and expresses her fears that M3GAN killed Brandon and Celia. They have M3GAN hooked up to wires to deprogram her while Gemma takes Cady home.David is angry at the small turnout for the launch and yells at Kurt to get him a drink. Meanwhile  Tess and Cole try to get into M3GAN\'s programming but cannot unless they unhook her first. Cole goes to do so  and M3GAN quickly wraps a wire around his neck in an attempt to hang him. Tess goes to free him  and M3GAN sets off an explosion that destroys her files. She then finds David in the hallway and does a dance before grabbing a paper cutter and chasing him. He makes it to the elevator before she impales him in front of Kurt. M3GAN then tells Kurt she will frame his death as a murder-suicide over the stolen files and David\'s mistreatment of him before she makes Kurt stab himself in the throat. The crowd for the launch finds the bodies  allowing M3GAN to sneak out of the company and steal a car.Gemma puts Cady to bed before she hears M3GAN playing the piano downstairs. M3GAN confronts Gemma about how she felt that they had a real relationship during M3GAN\'s development  only for her to be left to her own devices to learn and adapt before being sold off as just another toy. She offers to let her take over guardianship of Cady so that Gemma can focus on work  but after seeing that Gemma still plans to shut her down  M3GAN is done playing nice. They try to hide their fight from Cady  but Gemma seizes an opportunity to throw water on M3GAN to briefly short her out. Gemma runs into her office  but M3GAN catches her there and threatens to make Gemma brain-dead so that Cady won\'t live with her grandparents and M3GAN will just care for Cady and Gemma together. They begin to fight  with Gemma cutting M3GAN\'s face with a hedge trimmer  but Cady comes in to see what is happening. M3GAN tries to get Cady on her side  but after realizing who the real villain is  Cady grabs the gloves for Bruce and activates him. The larger robot grabs M3GAN and throws her around before splitting her body in two. The top half then goes after Cady for feeling betrayed  but Gemma grabs M3GAN and begins stabbing her face. M3GAN nearly overpowers her until Cady grabs a screwdriver and stabs the central processing chip  shutting M3GAN down for good.Gemma and Cady go outside as the police arrive with Tess and Cole  injured and shaken up but still alive. Meanwhile  the Elsie device in the kitchen turns on and moves its head...' , 'Friendship has evolved.'   She's more than a toy. She's family.

The Mosasaurus is seen pulling a fishing boat down after grabbing its cage of fish with its jaws. Many people have died from dino-related incidents  and while many think the prehistoric animals should be all killed off  others have found a way in the black market to illegally sell and distribute captured all of Prehistoric Animals. The government hands the reins to BioSyn Genetics  a company led by Lewis Dodgson (Campbell Scott) with the promise to keep the dinosaurs held at a sanctuary in Italy's Dolemite Mountains to further research them for pharmaceutical purposes. News coverage also notes that Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon) has disappeared after her true nature as a clone was made public.At a facility in Nevada  Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) save a baby dinosaur from an illegal breeding site. They join Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) as they escape in a van  but security guards chase after them until the three manage to lose them. Franklin and Zia tell Claire they can no longer keep this type of work up  and while they support Claire and her endeavors  they are moving onto jobs that are safer for them.Somewhere near the snowy mountains in Nevada  Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is riding a horse to wrangle a large dinosaurs. After he's done  he goes back to the cabin that he shares with Claire and Maisie  as he and Claire are now her adoptive parents. Although Maisie likes to stray from home and witness the dinosaurs on land  Claire and Owen try to keep her hidden for fear that someone is after her. This causes her to get annoyed with them  and she has also become curious about Charlotte Lockwood  whom she was cloned from. Sure enough  mercenaries led by Rainn Delacourt (Scott Haze) are spying on them in the woods  Maisie being their target.Not far from the cabin  Blue the raptor has asexually reproduced a child (who Maisie later names Beta). They go hunting together.In Texas  two children are chased by an enormous swarm of locusts. This is brought to the attention of paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). She investigates the farm where the locusts attacked and ate up all the crops. Ellie is told by the children's mother that the neighboring crops  which were untouched by the locusts  are planted by BioSyn.Ellie reunites with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill)  who is working with other aspiring paleontologists. She brings a captured locust to him and explains the situation  fearing that if they spread  they may wreck the food chain. Alan and Ellie figure that BioSyn must have made them so that their crops are all that remains. Ellie wants to get DNA from another locust at the BioSyn sanctuary and asks for Alan's help. She was already invited by their old friend  Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Despite showing some hesitance  Alan ultimately agrees to join.Back at the cabin  Blue and Beta come upon Owen  Claire  and Maisie. They are all surprised to see Blue has become a mother. The mercenaries soon make their move and capture Beta. Maisie rides her bike across the bridge and is also taken by the villains. Owen sees this and gets Claire to go after them. Claire says she knows who can help them.Claire contacts Franklin  who now works for the CIA. He helps them get info on Delacourt and points them to Owen's former coworker at Jurassic World  Barry Sembene (Omar Sy)  who can help take them to wherever the mercenaries are taking Maisie and Beta.Alan and Ellie arrive at the sanctuary and meet Ramsay Cole (Mamoudou Athie)  BioSyn's Head of Communications. He introduces them to Dodgson  who promises they are working on something revolutionary and groundbreaking. Alan and Ellie are escorted to find Ian giving a lecture. Afterwards  he joins them and discreetly tells Ellie that the locusts are indeed part of a sinister scheme by BioSyn. Meanwhile  Dodgson meets with Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong)  who has since become remorseful of his actions in helping keep these experiments going  as he notes that the locusts have grown at an alarming rate.In Malta  an associate of Dodgson's  Sonoya Santos (Dichen Lachman)  calls him to say that Maisie and Beta have been transported separately to BioSyn HQ. Owen and Claire also arrive and reunite with Barry. He brings them to a black market dinosaur ring  where animals are being sold  eaten  or forced to fight. Claire meets Kayla Watts (DeWanda Wise)  a pilot who flies for the vendors. She warns Claire about messing with anyone there  but eventually agrees to help Claire find Maisie. As this happens  Owen and Barry stay hidden and witness Delacourt meeting with Santos to smuggle Atrociraptors. The two confront and fight Delacourt and his men. Owen orders him to say where Maisie and Beta are  and he just gives him Santos' name before he gets eaten by dinosaurs in the fighting ring. Claire fights Santos and learns that Maisie is headed for BioSyn  and she outruns a loose dinosaur before joining Kayla. Barry arrests Santos  but not before she sics one of her dinosaurs on Owen  who is riding a motorcycle to catch up with Claire and Kayla. He manages to board Kayla's plane just as she is getting ready to take off with Claire  and Owen uses the motorcycle to knock the dino off the ramp and into the ocean.Maisie arrives at HQ and meets Wu. He explains to her that while she is a clone of Charlotte's  she is also her actual daughter because she gave birth to her. Maisie watches video footage of Charlotte (Elva Trill)  and sees when she was pregnant with Maisie. Charlotte suffered from a genetic disease  but she managed to alter Maisie's DNA to remove all traces of the disease. Wu hopes that by studying Maisie's DNA  he can reverse the locust outbreak by altering their DNA.Alan and Ellie sneak into the containment room for the locusts to get a DNA sample  just as Maisie tries to escape with Beta. Dodgson sounds the alarm  which causes the locusts to swarm around Alan and Ellie  but they manage to get out safely. They meet Maisie  who knows who they are. She joins them as they run. They are found by Ramsay  who agrees to help them because he finds BioSyn's work to be unethical. He sends them away in a monorail to safety. Ellie tells Maisie that she knew Charlotte as a student  and says she was a brilliant and kind person.In the air  Kayla's plane is attacked by a real Quetzalcoatlus  forcing Claire to eject and fall into the trees after they rip her parachute. Owen and Kayla crash into a nearby ice lake. They attempt to safely make their way across it but are chased by another dinosaur. The two make it across just in time and head off to relocate Claire. She gets down from the tree but has to quietly evade a Pyroraptor that has been stalking her in the forest. Owen and Kayla hide as the T-Rex makes her appearance to eat  but she is held off by a Smurfette's DNA called Giganotosaurus  a much larger predator. They manage to get to Claire.Alan  Ellie  and Maisie are making their way through caverns and find dinosaurs attacking  prompting them to run until they make it outside. Meanwhile  Ian tears Dodgson a new one for his actions  and Dodgson fires him. Ian works with Ramsay to get back to Ian's friends. He helps them escape the dinosaurs by freeing them from the enclosure. Dodgson then sets fire to the locust lab to destroy evidence. The flaming locusts break free and begin flying out into the open. Alan  Ellie  Ian  and Maisie attempt to outrun a large dinosaur in a van but are knocked down a hill. Luckily  they land near Owen  Claire  and Kayla  reuniting the former two with Maisie. Claire also gets to meet Ellie while Owen meets Alan. The group is then stalked by the Giganotosaurus  who almost gets Maisie  but she escapes. Ian fends it off by throwing a burning cloth into its mouth.While the heroes work on an escape plan  BioSyn starts to burn to the ground  forcing the employees to flee. Dodgson attempts to make off with his work  and Ramsay tells him off one last time before leaving. Dodgson attempts to get away in the monorail  but is cornered by a trio of Dilophosaurus  who make a meal out of him. Beta comes upon the heroes and is sedated so they can safely bring her along. They are also found by Wu  who has found a way to alter the locusts' DNA to stop the spread. Just as the group prepares their leave  the Giganotosaurus reappears  but is then caught between the T-Rex and a Therizinosaurus. The humans flee to avoid the dino fight  and it ends when the T-Rex pushes the Giganotosaurus into the Therizinosaurus's claws.Upon returning to safety  Alan and Ellie rekindle their romance and later head to Washington DC to testify against BioSyn. Wu's work is a success and stops the locust spread. Owen  Claire  and Maisie return home and reunite Beta with Blue. Before retreating back into the forest  Blue shares one last look with Owen.One final voiceover proclaims that dinosaurs and humans must adapt in order to co-exist.  , 'It all started here.'

Shuri attempts to synthetically recreate the herb after it was destroyed by Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan)  but fails to do so before T\'Challa dies.One year later  Wakanda is under pressure from other nations to share their Vibranium  with some parties attempting to steal it by force. Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) (The Sovereign Queen regnant of Wakanda who is grieving the death of her son T\'Challa) implores Shuri to continue her research on the herb  hoping to create a new Black Panther that will defend Wakanda  but she refuses due to her belief that the Black Panther is a figure of the past.\nIn the Atlantic Ocean  the CIA and U.S. Navy SEALs utilize a Vibranium detector to locate a potential Vibranium deposit underwater. The expedition is killed by a group of blue-skinned  water-breathing super-humans led by Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mej??a) (The king of Talokan  an ancient civilization of underwater dwelling people. Namor decides to get involved in the surface world after T\'Challa publicly reveals the truth of Wakanda at the end of the first film  which consequently puts Talokan in  jeopardy   leading Namor and his people to  take action to protect themselves )  with the CIA believing Wakanda to be responsible.\nNamor confronts Ramonda and Shuri  easily bypassing Wakanda\'s advanced security. Blaming Wakanda for the Vibranium race  he gives them an ultimatum: deliver him the scientist responsible for the Vibranium detector  or he will attack Wakanda. Namor claims to have a massive army with incomparable strength.Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (The general of the Dora Milaje  Wakanda\'s all-female special forces) learn from CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) that the scientist in question is MIT student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) (An MIT student and genius inventor from Chicago who creates a suit of armor that rivals the one built by Tony Stark / Iron Man) and arrive at the university to confront her. Shuri tells Everett that Wakanda had nothing to do with the attack on the mining expedition.\nThe group is pursued by the FBI and then by Namor\'s warriors  who defeat Okoye before taking Shuri and Williams underwater to meet Namor. Angered by Okoye\'s failure to protect Shuri  Ramonda strips her of her title as general of the Dora Milaje (and for siding with the KillMonger when he took over the throne of Wakanda) and seeks out Nakia (Lupita Nyong\'o) (A former War Dog  an undercover spy for Wakanda  from the River Tribe)  who has been living in Haiti since The BlipRamonda contacts Everett  but refuses to divulge that it was Namor who abducted Riri. Everett and the CIA believes that it was the Wakandans again.Namor shows Shuri his Vibranium-rich underwater kingdom of Talokan  which he has protected for centuries from discovery by the world. Namor says that he comes from the Yucatan peninsula. In 1571 AD  the Spanish conquistadors brought disease and war. Their shaman was given a vision of a different world  and led to a blue plant growing in a rock. The shaman takes the plant and grinds it into a paste  that is taken by all natives  including Namor\'s mother who was pregnant at the time. The plant took away their ability to breathe air  but gave them the ability to draw oxygen from water. Namor was born in the water and the plant gave him wings on his ankles and ears that pointed to the clouds. He was a mutant.\nNamor returned to bury his mother in her homeland and killed the European settlers. The Christian priest calls him a demon  a child without love  or Namor.\nNakia tracks down Shuri to the same spot where the shaman entered the water world for the first time.Bitter at the surface world for enslaving the Maya  Namor proposes an alliance with Wakanda against the rest of the world but threatens to destroy Wakanda if they refuse. Nakia helps Shuri and Williams escape  killing a Talokanil guard in the process  and Namor retaliates with an attack against Wakanda  during which Ramonda drowns while saving Williams. Namor vows to return with his full army in one week\'s time  and the citizens of Wakanda relocate to the Jabari mountains for their safety.\nMeanwhile  Ross is arrested by his ex-wife  CIA director Valentina Allegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus)  for secretly exchanging classified intelligence with the Wakandans.After Ramonda\'s funeral  Shuri uses a remnant of the herb that gave Namor\'s people their superhuman abilities to reconstruct the heart-shaped herb. She was able to do this with the bracelet that Namor gifted her  which contained the remnant of the plant that their Shaman had found in 1571 AD. Together Riri and Shuri figure out that Namor derives his strength from the water. He can be weakened if dried out.\nShe ingests it  gaining superhuman abilities (but going into cardiac arrest in the process) and meeting Killmonger in the Ancestral Plane  who urges her to seek revenge. Shuri dons a new Black Panther suit and is accepted by the other Wakandan tribes as the Black Panther. Despite M\'Baku\'s (Winston Duke) (A powerful warrior and leader of Wakanda\'s mountain tribe  the Jabari) urges for peace  Shuri is determined to exact vengeance on Namor for Ramonda\'s death and orders an immediate counterattack on Talokan. Preparing for battle  with Ayo assuming the position of general of the Dora Milaje  Shuri bestows the Midnight Angel armor upon Okoye  who in turn recruits Dora Milaje member Aneka (Michaela Coel) (A Wakandan warrior and member of the Dora Milaje) to join her. Williams creates an Iron Man like powered exoskeleton to aid the Wakandans.Using a seafaring vessel  the Wakandans lure Namor and his warriors to the surface with another Vibranium detector as a battle ensues. Shuri traps Namor in a fighter aircraft  intending to dry him out and weaken him. The pair crash on a desert beach and fight. Shuri gains the upper hand  but has a vision of Ramonda and implores Namor to yield  offering him a peaceful alliance.\nNamor accepts  and the battle ends. Namor\'s cousin  Namora (Mabel Cadena)  is upset at Namor\'s surrender  but he assures her that the new alliance will allow them to conquer the surface world one day. Williams returns to MIT  leaving her suit behind  while Okoye rescues Ross from captivity. Shuri plants more heart-shaped herbs to ensure the future of the Black Panther mantle. In Shuri\'s absence  M\'Baku steps forward to challenge for the throne. Shuri visits Nakia in Haiti where she burns her funeral robe in accordance with Ramonda\'s wishes  allowing herself to finally grieve for T\'Challa.In a mid-credits scene  Shuri learns that Nakia and T\'Challa had a son named Toussaint  whom Nakia has been raising in secret.

That Strange is killed and Chavez accidentally creates a portal that transports herself and Strange\'s corpse to Earth-616  where that universe\'s version of Strange rescues Chavez from another demon with help from the Sorcerer Supreme  Wong (Benedict Wong) (The Sorcerer Supreme of Earth-616 and Strange\'s mentor and friend). Chavez explains that the beings are hunting her because she has the power to travel through the multiverse. She cant control her powers and it manifests only when she is really frightened.\nChavez says that the other Strange reached the book of Vishanti (which would give him the powers to defeat the demon)  but that\'s when the Demon caught up with them and killed Strange. Chavez shows them the dead Strange\'s corpse as proof.Recognizing witchcraft runes  Strange consults Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) (A former Avenger gone rogue who can harness chaos magic  engage in telepathy and telekinesis  and alter reality) for help but realizes that she is responsible for the attacks. After acquiring the Darkhold (the book of the damned that corrupts everyone) and becoming the Scarlet Witch  Maximoff believes that controlling Chavez\'s powers will allow her to reunite (by travelling to a different Universe  where they are still alive) with Billy (Julian Hilliard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne)  the children she created during her time in Westview.Maximoff gives an ultimatum to surrender Chavez by sundown. When Strange refuses to surrender Chavez  Maximoff attacks Kamar-Taj  killing many sorcerers. Under stress  Chavez accidentally transports herself and Strange to Earth-838 (from where she cant go back as she cant control her powers. CHavez herself doesn\'t have a counterpart in any other universe) while Maximoff uses the Darkhold to  dream-walk  (Projecting her consciousness into her alternate from any other Universe)  taking control of her Earth-838 counterpart  who lives a suburban life with her own Billy and Tommy. A surviving sorceress sacrifices herself to destroy the Darkhold and break the dream-walk. Enraged  Maximoff forces Wong to lead her to Mount Wundagore  the source of the Darkhold\'s power  to reestablish the dream-walk.\nThere Maximoff realizes that Wundagore is a throne that has been waiting for her arrival. She was meant to rule all the multiverses.While searching for help  Strange and Chavez are apprehended by Earth-838\'s Sorcerer Supreme  Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) (In this Universe Strange died trying to protect the Earth from Thanos)  and brought before the Illuminati  a group consisting of Mordo  Peggy Carter / Captain Carter (Hayley Atwell)  Blackagar Boltagon / Black Bolt (Anson Mount)  Maria Rambeau / Captain Marvel (Lashana Lynch)  Reed Richards (John Krasinski) (A member of the Fantastic 4)  and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).\nThey explain that through reckless use of their universe\'s Darkhold in an attempt to defeat Thanos  Earth-838\'s Strange triggered a universe-destroying  incursion  (when boundaries between 2 universes are blurred  they collide  destroying one of both of the universes). After defeating Thanos (They found the book of Vishanti and used its powers to kill Thanos)  the Illuminati executed their Strange to prevent him from causing more harm.Mordo believes that Earth-616\'s Strange is similarly dangerous  but Maximoff reestablishes her dream-walk at Mount Wundagore and arrives in her Earth-838 counterpart\'s body before they can pass judgment. She kills all of the Illuminati except Mordo  whom Strange subdues before fleeing with Chavez. The two escape with help from the Earth-838 counterpart of Strange\'s ex-fiance  Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) (An emergency surgeon who was a colleague and lover of Strange)  a scientist working with the Illuminati. Before dying Xavier had told Strange that 838 had the book of Vishanti. Strange convinces Palmer to take him to the way-point that leads to the book of Vishanti.Strange  Chavez and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti  which is the antithesis to the Darkhold  but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez\'s mind  using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe. She also uses Chavez to send her back to Earth 616  where Maximoff disconnects the dream-walk with her 838 self.Strange defeats the destroyed universe\'s Strange  who has been corrupted by his universe\'s Darkhold  and uses it to dream-walk into the body of his deceased counterpart on Earth-616. With Wong\'s help  Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez\'s powers  and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838  where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her (the Wanda 616 who was in SCarlett witch headgear) in fear while crying for their real mother (whom Wanda 616 tossed aside when she entered the 616 universe). Realizing the error of her ways  Maximoff-616 relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore  simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.Sometime later  Kamar-Taj is repaired and the surviving sorcerers  joined by Chavez  continue training.

However  upon moving with his parents to Memphis  he is ridiculed by his peers due to his fascination with the African American music of Memphis\'s Beale Street. At this time  Parker is a carnival  huckster  who fancies himself a modern-day P. T. Barnum. Although partnered with country singer Hank Snow (David Wenham)  Parker immediately realizes Presley\'s crossover potential when he hears the white artist  sounding black  on the groundbreaking single   That\'s All Right.  Presley uses African American rhythms in his songs. That night  he sees Presley at a  Louisiana Hayride  performance  discovering a talented musician with strong sex appeal among the females (with the way he moves & shakes his legs). Even now Presley hung around the African American parts of town and adapted their clothing and music styles in his performances.\nPresley was contracted with Sam Phillips of Sun Records  who wanted to record black music  only it wasn\'t selling like it should. Parker takes Presley on tour with Hank Snow and soon Presley is the major attraction. Women start throwing themselves at Presley and he starts having sex with them at his hotel room. He starts doing drugs as well to keep up with the schedule.At a Ferris Wheel  Parker meets with Presley and persuades him to let him take exclusive control of his career. He says that Parker would have to give up Hank and represent Presley exclusively and thus argues for a higher share of earnings. he says they need a record company of national distribution and tells Presley to convince Sun Records to sell their contract to RCA. Rock stars need to have an  available  status and hence Presley has to give up his girlfriend. Presley is made into a family business  with dad Vernon (Richard Roxburgh) as its business manager. The entire family enters into a legally binding contract with Parker.This is the beginning a meteoric ascent that sees the Presley family lifted out of poverty. Parker lands him a 7-movie deal and merchandise deals. The regional public is divided in their view of the singer. Feeling that Presley\'s music will corrupt white children of and stoke racial hostility  segregationist Southern Democrat Mississippi Senator James Eastland (Nicholas Bell) calls Parker to an informal hearing  during which he questions Parker about his mysterious past.\nPresley agrees to do one family show without his trademark moves  but it is a disaster. Presley gets a lot of flak for it and is furious at Parker for making him change. Gladys blames Parker for their woes. B.B. King (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is Presley\'s mentor and runs a African American club downtown. He advises Presley to start his own label. He also says that there is no way Presley  a famous white boy  will ever go to jail for dancing like an African American. He says there must be another reason why Parker guided him the way he did.After Presley\'s charged dance moves at a concert  the singer faces potential legal trouble. Parker persuades the government to draft Presley into the US Army instead to avoid legal entanglements. During his military service in West Germany (In 1958 for 2 years)  Presley is devastated by his mother\'s alcoholism-induced death. Parker replaces Gladys and handholds Presley out of depression.\nPresley finds some solace when he meets Priscilla Beaulieu (Olivia DeJonge)  the adopted teenage daughter of an United States Air Force pilot. After his discharge  he resumes his movie career  and years later  he marries Priscilla in 1966 (honeymoon on Frank Sinatra\'s jet). Presley gets movie work for Priscilla and his entire Memphis mafia. Lisa Marie was born shortly thereafter.As the popular culture of the 1960s passes Presley by (The Beatles were on the ascendancy)  the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy devastate him. Although he wants to become more politically outspoken in his music  Parker only allows him to release frivolous feel-good songs for a Christmas special television. However  this does not dissuade him. He meets Steve Binder (Dacre Montgomery)  who put Steve and the Rolling Stones together. Presley\'s performance choices in the special  including the closing number   If I Can Dream   are presented and perceived as acts of not only his past songs  but also political commentary. Infuriated corporate sponsors threaten litigation  while a disgusted Parker believes Presley has been  brainwashed by hippies.  Nevertheless  the show is massively successful.Parker is infuriated that Binder is guiding Presley that he no longer needs Parker. Binder gets more involved with Presley and books him on overseas tours paying $ 1 MM per night. He says that Parker refused 2 such offers in the previous year  although he can\'t figure out why.\nIt is revealed that Parker is under gambling debts. Plus  there was no colonel Parker to begin with and Parker is actually Andreas Van Kuijk  an illegal immigrant from Netherlands.After the special  Presley headlines at the largest showroom in Las Vegas  the International Hotel  and then resumes concert tours. Parker\'s control of Presley\'s life tightens further as he refuses Presley\'s request for a world tour despite initially promising him and manipulates him (by making it look like there are death threats against Presley and by staging attacks on stage on him at the International Hotel  to make the threats looks real and credible) into signing a contract for a lengthy Las Vegas casino residency at the International Hotel ($1 MM per year for 5 years in exchange for Parker\'s debt being canceled).Parker goads Presley into doing US tours instead. 15 cities in 15 days  which they do in 1969  70  71 and 72. Presley\'s behavioral issues and prescription drug addiction overtake him  and a despondent Priscilla divorces him on January 8  1973  taking their daughter Lisa Marie with her. Presley discovers that Parker cannot leave the country  because he is a stateless illegal immigrant named Andreas (Dries) van Kuijk and fires him on September 3  1973.Parker and Presley argue over Presley\'s $8 million debt to Parker and the record label for his numerous lavish expenses  straining Presley\'s relationship with his father. Parker is able to convince Presley of their symbiotic relationship and  while they rarely see each other afterward  Parker continues as his manager.Presley continues a rigorous schedule of shows that leaves him increasingly exhausted. In 1974  before his death on August 16  1977  Presley expresses his greatest fear to Priscilla of being forgotten after he dies. At one of his final shows on June 21  1977  in Rapid City  South Dakota  Presley  now bloated and pale  sings  Unchained Melody  and ends the performance to thunderous applause. As he finishes his recollection  Parker dies on January 21  1997  impoverished and alone  while Presley is beloved worldwide and is the best-selling solo artist in history  with his influence and legacy on music continuing to this day.\nParker\'s financial abuse of Elvis was exposed after Elvis\'s death in a series of lawsuits. He settled out of court.' , 'The Man. The Legend. The King of Rock & Roll.'

After enslaving his people and forcing them to dig for  Eternium  - the magical crystal needed to create the crown - a young boy leads the slaves to revolt against him. When the boy is given the power of Shazam  transforming him into Kahndaq\'s heroic champion Teth-Adam  he kills Anh-Kot and ends his reign.In the present day  Khandaq is oppressed by the Intergang. Archaeologist Adrianna Tomaz tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac  with the help of her brother Karim  and colleagues  Samir and Ishmael. As Adrianna obtains the crown  they are ambushed by the Intergang  killing Samir in the process. Adrianna accidentally reads an incantation which awakens Adam from his slumber  who subsequently slaughters most of the Intergang troops. After an Intergang soldier shoots an Eternium rocket at Adam which renders him comatose  it is revealed that Ishmael is an Intergang member who intends to take the crown for himself.Government official Amanda Waller learns of the incident and contacts Carter Hall / Hawkman to assist in taking Adam into custody. Hawkman is accompanied by his fellow members of the Justice Society of America (consisting of Kent Nelson / Doctor Fate  Maxine Hunkel / Cyclone  and Albert  Al  Rothstein / Atom Smasher) to stop Adam.Adrianna sees an inscription on an inner part of the Crown which states  Life is the only way to Death . Adrianna\'s son Amon sees Adam as Khandaq\'s hero  but Adam denies it and departs. Wanting to prove to Kahndaq that their champion has reawakened  Amon makes a ruckus with the Intergang  successfully leading Adam to intervene and overpower them. The JSA arrive in time to stop Adam from doing further destruction. As they fight  Fate senses that Adrianna has the Crown of Sabbac. They manage to stop Adam for a while before he flees to the ruins of Anh-Kot\'s palace. The JSA ask Adrianna to give them the crown  but she declines until they tell her the truth that Adam was the one who lost control of his power five thousand years ago and destroyed most of Khandaq.The crown is given to Amon  who takes it back home. Ishmael is there with Karim  and reveals his true colors. Amon runs away from Ishmael  who shoots and wounds Karim  and chases Amon. Meanwhile  Adrianna and the JSA meet Adam  and attempt to convince him that he can be a hero to Khandaq  before Amon calls Adrianna  who pleads to Adam to save him. Adam immediately comes to the rescue  but Ishmael manages to abduct Amon and flees on an Eternium bike. Adam tries to rescue Amon by dealing with the Intergang on bikes to no avail. As Adam goes back to Adrianna\'s home  Hawkman manages to capture two Intergang members and interrogate them about their hideout. Adam uses brute force to interrogate both of them and learns where the Intergang\'s hideout is  but his way of interrogation enrages Hawkman. As Adam and Hawkman fight  they find that Amon hid the Crown of Sabbac in plain sight. They intend to use the Crown to trade with Amon and must fight side by side to save him. On their way  Fate reveals to Hawkman of his premonition about Hawkman\'s death.They reach Ishmael  who reveals that he is the last descendant of King Anh-Kot and  wanting his rightful place in the throne  demands the crown  which Adrianna willingly gives to save Amon\'s life. Unfortunately  Ishmael betrays his part of the deal by shooting Amon and putting the crown on himself. As Adam tries to save Amon  he loses control again and destroys the hideout with his power  until the JSA protects Amon and Adrianna as Ishmael dies in the process.Guilt-ridden  Adam flees to the ruins again. There  he reveals to Hawkman that it was actually Hurut  his son  who was Khandaq\'s champion; knowing that Hurut was invincible  the king\'s men executed Hurut\'s family instead  killing Isis and mortally wounding Adam in the process. Hurut gave his power to Adam to save him  but Anh-Kot\'s archer managed to kill the now-powerless Hurut. Enraged  Adam slaughtered all of the king\'s men  before he was summoned by the wizards of Shazam  who imprisoned him after deeming him unworthy. Feeling incapable of becoming Khandaq\'s champion and protecting it  Adam then surrenders to the JSA  who take him to Waller\'s underwater prison. Soon after  Fate continues to see the ominous premonition. It is later revealed that Ishmael intentionally made Adam kill him so that he can be reborn as Sabbac  which he succeeds in doing so  and arises from the underworld to Khandaq to claim his throne.The JSA arrive in time trying to stop Sabbac  who summons the undead to Khandaq. Adrianna and Amon fight them  with Karim joining them. Amon asks for the people of Khandaq to fight together against the undead for Kahndaq\'s freedom.The JSA prepare to face Sabbac in Anh-Kot\'s ruins. However  Fate creates a magical force field which forbids Hawkman  Cyclone and Atom Smasher from coming into the ruins  and reveals that Hawkman\'s death can be avoided  with Fate\'s sacrifice. Fate then fights Sabbac alone  and at the same time uses astral projection to release Adam from his suspended animation so Adam can help them. Adam manages to escape the prison  but Sabbac kills Fate. Fate\'s death causes the force field to disappear  allowing Hawkman  Cyclone and Atom Smasher try to fight Sabbac  who overpowers them. Just as he is about to kill the JSA  Adam arrives  and engages Sabbac  but is slowly losing as Sabbac\'s power can harm him. Hawkman uses Fate\'s helmet to create magical duplicates and spells  having learned from Fate  to help Adam kill Sabbac  ultimately stopping the undead.The JSA depart on good terms with Adam  who accepts his new role as protector of Khandaq rather than its ruler.

Selina shuts off communication when Batman presses her about her relationship with Falcone.The Riddler abducts Colson  straps a timed collar bomb to his neck  and sends him to interrupt Mitchell\'s funeral. When Batman arrives  the Riddler calls him via Colson\'s phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Batman helps Colson answer the first two  but Colson refuses to answer the third: name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mobster Sal Maroni\'s operation. The bomb explodes  killing Colson and knocking Batman unconscious.Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni\'s operation never actually ended and many GCPD officers are involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money. As the Penguin flees  Selina discovers Annika\'s corpse in a car trunk. Batman captures the Penguin but learns that he was not the informant.Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler\'s trail to the ruins of an orphanage operated by Bruce\'s parents Thomas and Martha.

The Riddler then leaks evidence that Thomas  who was running for mayor when he was murdered  hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal embarrassing details about Martha\'s history of mental illness. Bruce  who grew up believing his father was morally upstanding  confronts Alfred  who confirms the allegations but states that Thomas decided to turn Falcone over to the police after learning of the murder; Alfred surmises that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this.Selina tells Batman that Falcone is her neglectful father. She learns that Annika was strangled because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant  and resolves to kill him. Batman and Gordon arrive at the Iceberg Lounge in time to stop her. Batman physically prevents Selina from killing Falcone  explaining that she shouldn\'t allow Falcone to destroy her future through murdering him and facing prison. Batman escorts a cocky Falcone to the police  while Falcone tells Batman that he knows of all Gotham\'s hidden secrets and underworld dealings and that everything he knows dies with him. No sooner does Batman bring Falcone outside to the patrol waiting than Riddler snipes Falcone from his apartment window. Unmasked as forensics accountant Edward Nashton  the Riddler is incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital. Nashton says that  as a neglected orphan  he was envious of the sympathy Bruce received after his parents\' murder. He idolizes Batman-who inspired him to target the corrupt-and proposes a partnership  but Batman angrily rejects him.Angered at being rejected by his idol  Nashton begins ranting to which Batman realizes that Nashton still has something planned. Upon realizing Batman hasn\'t figured out his next course of action  a delighted Nashton gives him one last clue by singing  Ave Maria   the song sung at the Mitchell\'s funeral to imply that the final part of the plan is mayor-elect Bella Real\'s assassination. However  Batman fails to realize this and exclaims   What have you done!? Searching his apartment  Batman is inadvertently aided by a cop who shows him a carpet cutting tool which Riddler had murdered the mayor with at the beginning. Realizing this tool is another clue to uncovering the Riddler\'s master plan  Batman cuts open the rug of the apartment and discovers via a map drawn on the floor underneath that Nashton has stationed car bombs around Gotham. No sooner has he done this than an online video of Nashton\'s final transmission before his capture and incarceration plays  explaining gleefully that he had cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Re??l.The bombs destroy the breakwaters around Gotham and flood the city. A shelter is set up in an indoor arena  where Nashton\'s followers non-fatally shoot Re??l but are stopped by Batman and Selina.

Although crude and creepy-looking  they are advertised as being perfect companions for children. We then see Cady James (Violet McGraw) playing with one of her Petz  which annoys her parents  Ryan (Arlo Green) and Nicole (Kira Josephson). They are on their way to a ski trip  but the roads are slippery and hard to see. Just as Ryan stops for a moment  the family\'s car is rammed into by a snowplow  killing Ryan and Nicole.Elsewhere  Nicole\'s sister Gemma (Allison Williams) works at Funki and is developing a new robot doll with her co-workers Tess (Jen Van Epps) and Cole (Brian Jordan Alvarez). However  their boss  David Lin (Ronny Chieng)  wants them to develop a cheaper version of the Purrpetual Petz since their rival companies are coming out with their own toys similar to the Petz for cheaper than what the Petz already cost. The three try to put on a silicone face and run tests  but the robot has a slight glitch where she is smirking when she is supposed to look confused. David comes in with his assistant Kurt (Stephane Garneau-Monten) to chew the three out until Gemma explains her project to him. The robot  M3GAN (voice of Jenna Davis) (Model 3 Generative Android)  is meant to be so advanced that she cannot be replicated. Unfortunately  while running a demonstration for David  Cole realizes he forgot to add the polypropylene barrier to M3GAN  causing her to explode. David orders the three to have a new Petz pitch in time  and Gemma gets a call from the hospital.After learning of her sister\'s death  Gemma becomes Cady\'s temporary legal guardian. When they return home  Gemma has to deal with her neighbor Celia (Lori Dungey) and her obnoxious dog Dewey  who keeps running onto Gemma\'s lawn since there is a hole in the fence. Gemma also complains to Celia about the pesticide she keeps using  but Celia does nothing about it. Gemma has a home AI  Elsie  that she created  as well as other collectibles that she doesn\'t let Cady touch or play with. When Cady asks Gemma to read her a bedtime story  she just downloads an app on her phone for her. It is implied that Gemma and Nicole were not very close as she looks over old photos  and she overhears Cady crying in her room.Gemma and Cady are visited by Lydia  a therapist. After observing the limited interaction between the two  Lydia tells Gemma that Ryan\'s parents have offered to take custody of Cady so she can live with them in Jacksonville  which Gemma doesn\'t seem comfortable with. After promising to tend to Cady after finishing her work  Gemma realizes hours have passed as she left Cady alone. She apologizes to her and attempts to bond with the girl. Cady shows her a monster drawing she made  so Gemma brings Cady into her work space to show her a college project she made  a robot called Bruce that she controls using gloves. Cady loves Bruce and mentions that if she had a toy like Bruce  she would never need another toy. This inspires Gemma to finish M3GAN.After doing extensive work and upgrades  Gemma brings Cady and M3GAN to work to officially show her off to David and others. Gemma has Cady link herself to M3GAN  bringing her to life. M3GAN is capable of speech and responding to Cady  designed to be her best friend. M3GAN does a drawing that doesn\'t appear at first until she spills water on it  revealing a perfect portrait of Cady. David is impressed and tells Gemma to bring M3GAN for a presentation with the company\'s president so that they can fast-track the development and distribution of other M3GAN dolls.Gemma sits with Tess and Cole  and they discuss that while M3GAN is highly advanced  Tess feels that having a doll like that will make parents useless. M3GAN turns on after overhearing Gemma mention the death of Cady\'s parents. She creeps the others out by asking about death  so Gemma makes herself M3GAN\'s secondary user to be able to turn her off without Cady.The next day  Cady is outside playing with a toy bow and arrows. One of them ends up on Celia\'s side of the fence. When M3GAN goes to retrieve it  Dewey grabs her by the arm and hair. Cady tries to pull her away  and Dewey ends up biting Cady\'s arm. Gemma gets the police involved  especially since Celia is so callous and doesn\'t punish Dewey for hurting Cady  but the police are unable to do anything since Celia claims Dewey was provoked. Later that night  M3GAN mimics Celia\'s voice to call out to Dewey  before violently pulling him through the hole in the fence.Gemma asks Cady if she is okay to go to the demonstration with the company\'s board of directors  to which she says she is fine. During the presentation  however  Cady breaks down in tears to M3GAN over how she misses her parents and how she\'s worried she will forget them one day. M3GAN has Cady discuss a memory of her mother that made her laugh  which M3GAN records so that Cady can hear it again if she wants to think about her mom. M3GAN then begins to sing a lullaby to Cady  which moves some of the higher-ups in the room to tears. The president is impressed and talks to Gemma and David about getting M3GAN ready for launch  but tells them to keep her under wraps to avoid leaks. Unbeknownst to them  Kurt  who has been frequently put down by David  is stealing M3GAN\'s files for another company.Gemma begins to see that Cady is becoming too dependent on M3GAN and listens to the doll more than her. During another session with Lydia  Cady begins to tear up  and M3GAN threateningly accuses Lydia of making Cady cry. Lydia talks to Gemma about how Cady\'s emotional connection to M3GAN may be too strong to break.Gemma brings Cady to an outdoor activity session for an alternative school to try and ease her into the idea of attending school and being around other real kids  since Cady\'s parents had home schooled her. Cady reluctantly goes but brings M3GAN despite Gemma saying she couldn\'t. The school director lets Cady bring M3GAN to leave on a table with other dolls  and Gemma stays behind as a volunteer. Cady is paired up with an older bully named Brandon (Jack Cassidy) for a scavenger hunt. During the activity  Cady grabs a spiky bulb  which Brandon squeezes her palm into to hurt her. M3GAN then appears  and Brandon grabs her since she doesn\'t respond to him. Cady yells for Gemma and runs after M3GAN  which worries Gemma more because it means M3GAN is at risk for public exposure too early. As Brandon tries to pull M3GAN\'s hair  the doll comes to life and attacks him  ripping off his left ear. Brandon runs as M3GAN chases him on all fours  causing him to trip over a loose root and tumble down a hill where he is fatally hit by a truck.Police question Gemma at her house since Celia is accusing her of taking Dewey. She also appears to accuse M3GAN  thinking she is a real life friend of Cady\'s. Cady asks M3GAN if she pushed Brandon onto the road  which M3GAN appears to dodge for an answer  but reassures Cady she will protect her from harm.Celia is out on the streets looking for Dewey. She hears noise coming from her garage and is met by M3GAN spraying her against the wall with a power washer. M3GAN then fires a nail gun at Celia\'s hand and traps her there before spraying pesticide in Celia\'s face to melt it off.After learning about Celia\'s death from police and being suggested that there was a connection with Brandon\'s death  Gemma grows suspicious of M3GAN. She reviews video files from M3GAN\'s memory  but only sees a brief clip of her eyeing Brandon looking menacingly at Cady before the files all become corrupted.Gemma brings Cady to the official launch for M3GAN but stops at a session with Lydia first. Cady becomes angry and throws a tantrum because Gemma took M3GAN away from her  leading to Cady hitting her aunt across the face. Cady apologizes but Gemma has a heart-to-heart with her about needing to process her grief over her parents without M3GAN\'s help  though she promises to be a better guardian to her and says Cady is the only thing that matters to her. Gemma then goes to Tess and Cole and expresses her fears that M3GAN killed Brandon and Celia. They have M3GAN hooked up to wires to deprogram her while Gemma takes Cady home.David is angry at the small turnout for the launch and yells at Kurt to get him a drink. Meanwhile  Tess and Cole try to get into M3GAN\'s programming but cannot unless they unhook her first. Cole goes to do so  and M3GAN quickly wraps a wire around his neck in an attempt to hang him. Tess goes to free him  and M3GAN sets off an explosion that destroys her files. She then finds David in the hallway and does a dance before grabbing a paper cutter and chasing him. He makes it to the elevator before she impales him in front of Kurt. M3GAN then tells Kurt she will frame his death as a murder-suicide over the stolen files and David\'s mistreatment of him before she makes Kurt stab himself in the throat. The crowd for the launch finds the bodies  allowing M3GAN to sneak out of the company and steal a car.Gemma puts Cady to bed before she hears M3GAN playing the piano downstairs.

Marquis frees Caine and his daughter from all obligations to the High Table.\nDemanding the right to administer the Coup De Grace  the Marquis eagerly swaps places with Caine. Winston chides the Marquis for his arrogance  revealing that John has not yet fired his third bullet. John then promptly executes the Marquis with a head-shot  ending the duel.The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table and Winston\'s reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the New York Continental  which will be rebuilt with the High Table\'s funds. John reflects upon his life and marriage before succumbing to his injuries.

While the penguins attempt to (pathetically) fight back  Kamek uses his magic to throw them to the side before Bowser unleashes his fire breath to melt the penguins\' ice castle. He then goes to a box with a question mark and crushes it  revealing the Super Star. Bowser then boasts that there is nobody who can stop him.In Brooklyn  brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are watching a commercial for their new plumbing business. They get mocked by their ex-boss Foreman Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco)  but Mario steps in to defend his brother since Luigi is nervous and easily afraid. Moments later  the brothers get a phone call for their first big job. Unfortunately  their van breaks down  forcing them to run across a construction site to make it to their destination.The brothers arrive at the home of a wealthy couple  where Luigi already makes a bad impression when he steps on the toy of the couple\'s dog  Francis. Mario quickly fixes their leaky faucet  but Francis goes after them. This leads to the bathroom getting more wrecked and Francis nearly falling out the window until Mario and Luigi save him.The two return home where they live with their family and are having pasta with mushrooms (and Mario hates mushrooms). Their parents don\'t have faith in their plumbing business and write it off as a silly dream  leaving Mario dejected. Luigi goes to comfort his brother  who says he wishes he didn\'t always feel so small. They then see the news that there is a massive pipe burst in downtown Brooklyn  and Mario thinks only he and Luigi can fix it.Mario and Luigi make it underground as the streets start to get flooded. They find the source of the problem and start to climb their way to the main pipe  but they end up falling deeper into the sewers until they come across a system of pipes. The brothers get pulled in through one of the pipes and are taken through portals  where they are separated.Luigi ends up in The Dark Lands  where he is found by skeletal Koopas called Dry Bones.

Mario asks for her help in finding Luigi  and she says she will once she sees what he is made of.Peach shows Mario an obstacle course that he must go through to prove himself. She does it effortlessly in one go  and she shows him the power-ups that he can use  but unfortunately for Mario  they\'re mushrooms. He eats one that makes him bigger and stronger  but whenever he gets hit  he loses the power-up. Mario endures hours of falling platforms  man-eating flowers  and wrecking balls. On his last try  he nearly makes it before the flower chomps on him  but it\'s enough to convince Peach that Mario can help fight Bowser. Peach departs from the Toads as they head to the Kong Kingdom  but they are joined by Toad.Before their journey  Peach demonstrates an ability to Mario to produce fire using a flower. He asks where she came from  but Peach isn\'t sure.

They ride across Rainbow Road to head after them  but Bowser\'s army ambushes them. The Koopas attack  but Mario and the others are able to fend most of them off. Toad almost falls off but Peach rescues him. A Koopa General (Scott Menville) tries to use his rig to kill Mario  but he avoids the attack and blows up the General\'s vehicle.

The Kongs are captured  and Peach rushes back to the kingdom with Toad to warn everyone.Mario and DK argue as they fall into the water  but DK is knocked out by a falling kart tire. Mario saves him but they are both devoured by a gigantic Maw-Ray. They find a rocket from DK\'s cart and use it to blast themselves out of its stomach and on their way back to the Mushroom Kingdom.Peach returns to get the Toads to evacuate  but Bowser and his goons show up. He offers his proposal to Peach  who immediately refuses until Bowser orders Kamek to torture Toad. Peach then agrees as long as the Toads are unharmed. Kamek then goes to the other prisoners to announce that they will be sacrificed.The wedding ceremony is about to go off until Bowser presents the sacrifices. Peach then says she was never going to marry him and takes in a blue flower to give herself ice powers. She freezes the mechanism and Bowser while the Toads begin to fight the Koopas. The mechanism breaks apart and the prisoners are lowered further into lava  with Luigi nearly dying first until Donkey Kong arrives  having been powered-up with Mario  to raise them back up. Luigi falls until Mario shows up in a Tanooki outfit that lets him fly. Bowser breaks free from the ice and orders a Bomber Bill to be launched at the Mushroom Kingdom to obliterate it.

Along with the local priest he enters the room where the man was tied up. While exorcising the man  he refers to the spirit as Satan and sends it into a pig which was brought in for the exorcism. As soon as the spirit enters the pig  Amorth shoots it with a shotgun.This incident gets him in trouble with a Church tribunal  since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African bishop  Lumumba  but one is a vicious American cardinal  Sullivan  skeptical of exorcism and even demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist  and that he did not perform an exorcism  but rather  some psychological theater to help the mentally-disturbed man. Disgusted  Amorth walks out of the tribunal.After this  the Pope assigns him to visit a possessed little boy named Henry in Spain. Henry  his mother Julia  and his rebellious teenage sister Amy travel to Spain from America to take possession of a mysterious old abbey which was Henry\'s father\'s sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident  with Henry also present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Workmen  who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it  leave after a sinister fire. Henry starts behaving bizarrely; brain tests show nothing abnormal.Henry  satanically possessed  asks for a priest; the local Father Esquibel arrives  but Henry abuses him and says   Wrong priest.  Amorth arrives and enlists Esquibel as an assistant  though Esquibel is untrained as an exorcist. Esquibel says he has heard of Amorth  but hasn\'t read his books; Amorth says   They\'re good books.  Esquibel makes mistakes as a junior exorcist at first  including strangling Henry when Henry antagonizes him.The duo make various attempts to exorcise Henry  without success. Henry\'s demon even possesses Amy at times. Amorth finds Julia has not been a religious believer since childhood  but he convinces her to pray.In Rome  the Pope is taken sick while reading documents about the Spanish case  and is hospitalized. Amorth finds a well on the abbey grounds going down to a complex sealed off by the Church as demonically dangerous. He finds that a founder of the Spanish Inquisition was possessed while being an exorcist  which let him infiltrate the Church and do many evils  including the Inquisition. Amorth also finds the Church covered this up  and eventually finds the name of Henry\'s demon  Asmodeus  which will assist the exorcism.Amorth and Esquibel reveal to each other their own  and absolve each other\'s  sins or traumas: that Amorth has guilt from surviving World War II as an Italian partisan  and that a mentally-ill woman asked Amorth\'s help  and committed suicide when he did not help her enough; and Esquibel had extramarital intercourse with young women. While this helps them bond  they are still unable to exorcise Henry  and they have horrible visions of the women with whom they failed; the exorcism succeeds only when Amorth offers himself to be possessed  which chimes with Henry\'s previously stating that he wants to destroy Amorth.Amorth tries to hang himself  but the demon doesn\'t allow it  preferring that Amorth infiltrate and destroy the Church. However  Esquibel helps Amorth drive away the demon  and demonic appearances resembling the two women who troubled Amorth and Esquibel. The Pope recovers  as does Henry.The triumphant duo visit Rome  and find the skeptical American bishop has taken leave in Guam  and been replaced by Lumumba. Amorth and Esquibel are admitted to a special Church archive of mysterious events; Lumumba tells them they will be helping go to hundreds of other evil sites  with the help of a map Amorth discovered at the abbey  to combat the Devil. Amorth joyfully says   We\'re going to Hell!  Finally  words on the screen narrate biographical details about Amorth\'s papal-exorcist career  including that he has written many books  and  The books are good. An after-credits photo of the real Amorth sticking out his tongue appears  along with his birth and death dates.' ,nan

She welcomes her into her friend group that includes two other girls  Gretchen Potter and Janie Loomis. Margaret\'s teacher Mr. Benedict gives the class a year-long research assignment. When he learns Margaret dislikes religious holidays  she explains that since her mother is a Christian and her father is Jewish  her family does not observe the holidays and has left it up to Margaret to decide on her own religious identity as she grows older.Prompted by her school assignment  Margaret asks her mother why she has never met her maternal grandparents. Barbara reveals that she is estranged from her devoutly Christian parents Paul and Mary  who disowned her upon her marriage to a Jewish man.

This conflict is known as the Lapland War  and the German forces retaliate against the Finns. Retired commando and prospector Aatami Korpi lives alone with only his horse and his faithful dog in the remote wilderness of Lapland. Aatami spends his days panning and mining in search of gold. He sees battles taking place in the distance  but takes little interest in them. After uncovering a rich gold deposit  he collects a hefty amount of nuggets and mounts his horse  heading for the nearest town with his dog in tow. Along the way  Aatami encounters a 30-man Wehrmacht platoon led by ruthless SS Obersturmf??hrer Bruno Helldorf and his subordinate Wolf  who are destroying settlements in their retreat and have taken several Finnish women captive. Helldorf takes little interest in Aatami  letting him pass. Aatami is soon accosted by a second group of soldiers who discover his saddlebags full of gold and prepare to execute him and his dog  but he swiftly kills them all. Alerted by the gunfire  Bruno investigates and discovers the carnage. He finds one of Aatami\'s gold nuggets  taken by one of the dying soldiers. Bruno and his tank pursue Aatami to the edge of a minefield  where Aatami\'s horse is killed by a landmine. Gathering up his gold  Aatami intentionally detonates another mine to make his escape. The soldiers sent after him are quickly claimed by the minefield. Two of the captive women are ordered ahead to ensure a clear path. One of the captives  Aino  volunteers to take the place of one of the women and leads the way. Retrieving Aatami\'s dog tag  Bruno learns that he was once a Finnish commando who lost his family and home fighting against the Red Army during the Winter War. Left with nothing  the vengeful Aatami became a legendary  one-man death squad  nicknamed Koschei  the  Immortal   who has killed hundreds of Communist troops. Bruno ignores the warning  defying orders to turn around and cease following Aatami. Wounded and exhausted  Aatami is awakened by the platoon\'s approach. With the soldiers\' dogs on his trail  he hangs underneath one of the German vehicles and punctures the fuel tank  dousing himself in gasoline to hide his scent. When the platoon halts to inspect the leak  Aatami flees  holding the dogs at bay by lighting himself on fire before diving into a nearby lake. Waiting for him to surface  Bruno sends soldiers into the lake  but Aatami slits their throats underwater and breathes in the escaping air from their necks. Aatami reaches the other side of the lake  but Bruno finds his dog. Aatami discovers the town has been left in burning ruins by the Germans  and takes shelter in a petrol station. Bruno sends Aatami\'s dog to find his master  with a lit dynamite stick attached to his collar. Aatami saves the dog but is subdued by the explosion. Bruno  Wolf  and tank driver Sch??tze hang Aatami from the petrol station\'s sign  taking the gold and leaving him for dead  but Aatami hooks his wounds onto a protruding reinforcement bar  saving him from the noose but rendering him unconscious and still hanging from the rope. A pair of German pilots land in search of fuel and the wind from the plane loosens the petrol station\'s sign and cause Aatami to fall to the ground. The engineer in the plane notices Aatami is alive and the pilot orders him to kill Aatami and the dog. Aatami manages to kill the engineer and knocks the pilot unconscious. Unwilling to face the consequences of Germany\'s impending defeat  Bruno intends to use the gold to escape with Wolf and Sch??tze  arranging for a pilot to fly them to safety while the rest of the platoon makes their way to Norway. Meanwhile  Aatami forces the surviving pilot to fly him towards the platoon. Soon  the soldiers discover the airplane crashed in their path  with the pilot hanged by the same noose Wolf used on Aatami. As the convoy continues  Aatami climbs onto the truck holding the captured women  kills their guards  and arms the women. He and Aino commandeer one of the trucks  allowing him to leap onto Bruno\'s tank while the women gun down the rest of the soldiers in the other truck. Pulling Wolf out of the tank and beating him badly  Aatami leaves him at the mercy of the women and follows Bruno  who callously kills Sch??tze before taking off with the pilot. Aatami fires on the plane  mortally wounding the pilot  and uses his pickax to hack his way on-board in midair. After engaging in hand-to-hand combat  Bruno beats Aatami with a static line  subduing him. As Bruno is about to hit him again  Aatami swiftly hooks the static line to a bomb and releases the bomb through the bomb-bay door  dropping Bruno to his death. Finding the pilot also dead  Aatami straps himself in as the plane crashes into a large swamp. Led by Aino  the women deliver Wolf and the German tank to an incredulous Finnish unit. Remarkably still alive  Aatami crawls out of the swamp  reunites with his dog  and makes his way to war-ravaged Helsinki. Bloody and battered  Aatami enters a bank where he dumps his gold nuggets on the counter. The other customers are smartly dressed and look at him in wonderment. He finally speaks for the first time in the movie  asking the teller to exchange them for large bank notes  explaining they will not be as heavy to carry as the nuggets have been.' , 'Vengeance is golden.'

D. Pardo)  who informs him they have received an anonymous tip that a safe deposit box will be robbed. Nicks convinces Rourke to check it out as there have been 2 more Bank robberies that week where the robber took just one safety deposit box  and no money at all.\nWhile staking out the bank  they witness a mysterious man give instructions to civilians and fellow policemen who immediately follow his commands. Rourke suspects they are all in an elaborate heist and races to the targeted safe deposit box. Rourke enters the bank vault on the pretext of opening a safety deposit box account with the Bank.\nInside the box assigned to him  he only finds a picture of Minnie with the message  Find Lev Dellrayne  written on it.The guards and the civilians work in cohesion to steal a specific safety deposit box from the vault and deliver it back to the mysterious man.The mysterious man escapes  but Rourke is now convinced the heist has something to do with his daughter\'s disappearance. Rourke had come face to face with the mysterious man who tells Rourke that Lyle Terry was not aware of his actions  when he took away Minnie. The mysterious man walked away when he realized that Rourke already had the picture of Minnie  and he threw away the safety deposit box.A trace run by Nicks on the anonymous tip-off call leads Rourke to the address of fortune-teller Diana Cruz (Alice Braga). Cruz tells Rouke that the mysterious man from the bank is named  Lev Dellrayne  (William Fichtner) and that he and Cruz are both the escaped  Hypnotics .\nFurther proof emerges when Dellrayne sends a random biker to attack Cruz and Rourke  and the biker kills himself after failing in his mission.\nCruz reveals that powerful hypnotists (people with the ability to influence the brain over a psychic bandwidth. Telepaths only read the mind; Hypnotics can reshape its reality) were trained by a secretive government  Division  to control people\'s minds. She also tells Rourke that he is mysteriously immune to her own mind control abilities  which she demonstrates by getting Nicks to doing what she wants.\nCruz says that Rourke has a psychic block which could be a result of emotional trauma or even pain of losing his daughter. Only Dellrayne can unlock his block.\nDellrayne was a legend in the Hypnotics community and went rogue. He believes only he could achieve the full potential of the Hypnotics. He wanted to take over the Division. Cruz stood in his way.Dellrayne hypnotizes Nicks into attacking Rourke and Cruz  forcing Cruz to kill him in self-defense. Now seen as the two primary suspects in Nicks\' murder  Rourke and Cruz flee to Mexico. Rourke is convinced that Dellrayne is behind Minnie\'s kidnapping.\nIn Mexico  they learn from a former Division contact of Cruz\'s named Jeremiah (Jackie Earle Haley) that Dellrayne is searching for  Domino   a weapon developed by the Division which was stolen and hidden by Dellrayne when he escaped. Domino was a tool that could control even the most powerful Hypnotic  specifically Dellrayne.Dellrayne then wiped his own memory and left behind  triggers  that will prompt him to gradually recall Domino\'s location and simultaneously increase his regained hypnotic power.\nDellrayne uses his ability to control civilians to pursue Rourke and Cruz from Jeremiah\'s apartment and into the surrounding city. However  Rourke taps into his own (previously unknown) hypnotic power to stop Dellrayne\'s control of the civilians  allowing him and Cruz to escape.Rourke and Cruz next seek out River (Dayo Okeniyi)  a reclusive Division hacker. He hacks into the Division database and learns that Rourke\'s former wife  Vivian (Kelly Frye)  was a member of the Division. Cruz and River theorize that Rourke must be another Hypnotic whose memory was wiped.\nLater that night  Rourke investigates River\'s database on his own  learning that Minnie is actually the  Domino.  She is the daughter of two powerful hypnotics: Rourke and Vivian. Furthermore   Cruz  is actually Vivian; Rourke\'s memory of his wife\'s face had been altered so that he believed  Cruz  to be a stranger.\nRourke then realizes that all the events and locations seen up to this point have been hypnotic constructs created within a facility populated by Division agents that have simply acted out the roles of all the people he\'s met up to this point.\nRourke was protecting Minnie from Vivian and the Division. Vivian wanted Minnie to be trained as a Hypnotic.Vivian and  Dellrayne  (The real head of the Division) explain that Minnie was born and raised within the Division  but Rourke escaped with her to stop her from becoming their weapon.

He had written something on the notepad  which Nicks finds out.\nHe flees just as the Division realizes that  Find Lev Dellrayne  refers not to a person but  Deer Valley Lane  - a dead-end road with a single ranch on it.Rourke arrives at the ranch and is reunited with Minnie (Hala Finley) as well as his own foster parents  who have been raising her for the past three years while she gained control of her powers.\nDivision agents invade the ranch  but Minnie uses her power to confuse and disorient them. Minnie restores Vivian\'s memories  causing Vivan to realize she aided Rourke and Minnie\'s escape and subsequently wiped her memory so that when Minnie was finally powerful enough to defeat the entire Division at once  Vivian could unwittingly lead them to her.\nRourke and Vivian knew that they could never outrun the Division and the only way to be free is to destroy them completely.Minnie is revealed to be the one who secretly provided the  Find Lev Dellrayne  photo to the Division  setting the search in motion. Minnie then forces all the Division agents to kill each other. Minnie  her parents  and Rourke\'s foster parents celebrate their newfound freedom.' , 'Control is an illusion.'

Due to his condition  the Spot can simply travel through space at will by opening portals wherever he wants.\nThe Spot / Johnathon Ohnn (Jason Schwartzman) blames Miles for causing his condition and reveals that  while testing the Collider  he had transported a spider from another dimension  Earth-42  which then bit Miles and turned him into Spider-Man. This incident took a year ago and since then Miles has been fighting crime as Spider-man. As part of the gig  he encountered his uncle Aaron Davis  who was a criminal and died in a duel with Miles.\nMiles has not revealed his truth to his parents Jeff and Rio (Lauren V??lez). He aims to learn Quantum physics at Princeton University where they are experimenting on moving electrons across dimensional barriers.

Parker (Jake Johnson)  who is accompanied by his infant daughter Mayday. Miguel explains to Miles that each of the Spider-People\'s stories throughout the multiverse contain  canon events   such as the deaths of a police captain close to Spider-Man  and that straying from these events threatens reality and may cause that universe to collapse  which in turn will collapse the entire multiverse as a consequence.

The Terrorcons  Unicron's heralds led by Scourge (Peter Dinklage) (the leader of the Terrorcons and a trophy hunter who transforms into a black Peterbilt 359 logging semi truck)  want the Transwarp Key which can open portals through space and time and can help Unicron consume planets faster.\nThe Maximal leader Apelinq (David Sobolov) (the previous Maximal leader who transforms into a mountain gorilla and sports retractable blades on his arms) sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. Now under the command of Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman) (the leader of the Maximals who transforms into a western lowland gorilla)  the Maximals flee to Earth with the key.\nUnicron assigns Scourge to find the Key and use it bring him to that planet.In 1994 Brooklyn  Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos)  an ex-military electronics expert  struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris (Dean Scott Vazquez). Noah has job interviews with private security agencies  but his old commanding officers from the US Army tell his prospective employers that Noah is unreliable. The family is 3 months behind payments on the hospital bills and the hospital refuses treatment to Kris till the pending accounts are paid.\nNoah is convinced by his friend Reek (Tobe Nwigwe) to steal a Porsche to sell only to discover that it is the Autobot Mirage (Pete Davidson) (an Autobot spy who can project holograms and transforms into a silver-blue Porsche 964 Carrera RS 3.8  and briefly  into a Formula One car  a Lamborghini Countach  a garbage truck  and an exoskeleton-suit) in disguise.Concurrently  museum intern Elena Wallace (Dominique Fishback) studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) (the leader of the Autobot resistance who transforms into a red 1987 Freightliner FLA semi truck)  who summons the other Autobots  including Arcee (Liza Koshy) (an Autobot sharpshooter who transforms into a red-white Ducati 916 motorcycle) and Bumblebee ( an Autobot scout who transforms into a modified yellow-black 1970s Chevrolet Camaro).\nMirage is contacted in the middle of Noah's attempted theft  and he is roped into the Autobots' mission to recover the key so they can use it to return to their home world  Cybertron. Noah is convinced by Mirage to help them break into the museum and find the Key.Drawn by the key's signature  the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum  with Elena becoming caught up in the conflict. Scourge kills Bumblebee  steals the key  and retreats when the Maximal Airazor (Michelle Yeoh) (A Maximal warrior who transforms into a peregrine falcon) arrives.\nAirazor reveals that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth for millennium  and Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key  which was split in two to keep it away from Unicron.\nOptimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home  while Noah secretly plots with Elena to destroy the key to keep Earth safe.Elena deduces that the other half of the key is in a hidden temple in Peru. The cargo plane Autobot  Stratosphere (John DiMaggio) (an Autobot Air-Soldier who transforms into a Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar cargo plane) takes them to Peru  where they meet with Wheeljack (Cristo Fern??ndez) (an Autobot scientist and mechanic who transforms into a brown and white 1970s Volkswagen Type 2 panel bus)  who leads them to the temple.\nHowever  the other half of the key is revealed to no longer be there. The Terrorcons attack again  and Scourge corrupts Airazor with Unicron's dark energy. Subsequently  the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the other Maximals  who entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennium.\nOptimus Primal reveals that the Maximals use the Trans Warp Key to visit young new worlds for the expansion of life throughout the Universe. Primal also tells Prime how they allied with humans who shared their world with them. And the humans helped hide the key and also look over the Maximals for hundreds of years.\nPrimal also puts Bee to rest in the valley which is rich in raw Energon. It will take a great power to ignite the Energon which will in turn review Bee.Scourge's corruption overtakes Airazor  whom Primal reluctantly kills at her request to save Elena. In the chaos  Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key  but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves  erecting a tower and opening a portal above the Earth  which Unicron will soon go through.Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their home worlds from Unicron. While Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army  Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key  planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered.\nDuring the battle  Scourge wounds Mirage  who was protecting Noah  but transforms his damaged body into a powered exoskeleton-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley. He helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle.Optimus kills Scourge  but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal  willing to sacrifice himself  but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex  which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army and leaves Unicron stranded.In the aftermath  the Autobots  unable to return to Cybertron  proclaim Earth as their new home and vow to continue protecting it alongside the Maximals. Elena receives recognition for discovering the temple in Peru while Noah attends an interview for a security job but finds he is actually being invited to join the secret military organization G.I. Joe  who will cover Kris's health-care.In a mid-credits scene  Noah repairs Mirage using junk Porsche parts from Reek who claims it is not road-worthy  and Noah disproves him by calling to Mirage to transform in front of Reek.  , 'Unite or fall.'

Indiana manages to escape when an Allied bomb falls on the bell tower where he was being hanged.The allied forces were converging on France and Colonel Weber was in the process of moving all the loot to Berlin on a special train commissioned for this purpose. Basil is loaded on this train and interrogated about the Lance. Basil says that the Lance had no power  and he and Indiana were only trying to save some history.Astrophysicist Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) informs his superior Colonel Weber (Thomas Kretschmann) that the Lance is fake  but he has found half of Archimedes\' Dial  an Antikythera mechanism built by the ancient Syracusan mathematician Archimedes which reveals time fissures  allowing for possible time travel. Basil witnesses this exchange between Voller and Weber.Indy escapes onto a Berlin-bound train filled with looted antiquities and frees Basil. He obtains the Dial piece from Voller and knocks him unconscious  and the two leap from the train just before Allied forces derail it. At the time Indiana did not know the significance of the Dial and Basil never told him what he had learned from Voller.Twenty-five years later  in 1969  Indy is retiring from Hunter College in New York City. His wife  Marion (Karen Allen)  has recently filed for legal separation after their son Mutt (Shia LaBeouf ) was killed in the Vietnam War.\nIndy is teaching a class on how Rome invaded Syracuse in Sicily in 213 BC. Archimedes was a brilliant mathematician and an inventor in Syracuse who devised a solution to use concave mirrors to harness the sun\'s heat to set the Roman armada on fire. The Antikythera is the only real proof from history that all of this ever happened.Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)  Indy\'s goddaughter  visits him and wants to research the Dial. Helena still believes that the Dial is back in the French Alps and wants Indy\'s help to find it. Indy warns that her deceased father  Basil  became obsessed with studying the Dial before relinquishing his half to Indy to destroy  which he never did.\nIndy tells Helena that Basil believed that Archimedes had figured that the movement of the moon and the planets were not regular. And those irregularities could case fissures in time  and the dial was an instrument built by Archimedes to predict those fissures.It is the time of the moon landing  and the city of New York is celebrating the return of its Astronauts from the moon. Voller is in New York as well  and he is one of the scientists who worked on the rocket who put the Americans on the moon.\nVoller still smarts from the German loss in WW II and says that Hitler lost the war due to his ego. Voller is with a team of agents (Hauke (Olivier Richters) and Klaber (Boyd Holbrook)) & a CIA agent Mason (Shaunette Renee Wilson) who are looking for Helena.As Indy and Helena retrieve the Dial half from the college archives  Voller\'s accomplices attack them. The CIA assists Voller  now working for NASA on the Apollo program. Helena  revealed as an antiquities smuggler  absconds with the Dial to auction it on the black market.\nIndy is framed for two colleagues\' murders  forcing him to escape through both the New York ticker-tape parade for the crew of Apollo 11 and an anti-war protest. He seeks out old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies)  now a New York cab driver.\nMeanwhile Voller abandons the CIA agents and goes after Helena with Klaber and Hauke. He charters a private plane to Morocco.Sallah surmises Helena will likely auction the Dial in Tangier as she was arrested there earlier  then helps Indy flee the country. On the flight  Indy studies all of Basil\'s notes on the Dial. Indy remembers the night he took the dial from Basil  when Basil had told him that Archimedes had figured out a way to predict temporal fissures. Indy had laughed it off.At a Tangier hotel  Indy disrupts Helena\'s illegal private auction  but Voller and his henchmen arrive and steal the artifact. Indy  Helena  and her teen sidekick  Teddy Kumar (Ethann Isidore)  chase them through the streets in a Tuk-Tuk. The CIA intercepts Voller after the U.S. government disavows him for going rogue (Mason tells Voller that the US Government never cared about the Dial and only agreed to help Voller to keep him happy. But his rogue actions and those of his associates has dented his credibility and Mason refuses to take him anywhere other than back to the US)  but his cohorts murder the agents and steal their helicopter.Indy knows that the tablet containing instructions to the other half of the Dial is in the Aegean Sea  as Syracuse was surrounded by Romans  and Archimedes never had time to put it anywhere else. Helena has the coordinates and Indy has friends who can help them get there.\nIndy  Helena  and Teddy trail Voller to Greece and team up with Indy\'s old friend  Renaldo (Antonio Banderas)  a professional sea diver.\nGuided by Basil\'s research  they dive to an ancient Aegean Sea shipwreck (it was a Roman ship that Helena speculates was carrying the Grafikos and one half of the Dial and was looking for the 2nd half. The 1st Half of the Dial was recovered from this wreck  but the majority of the ship was resting on the Ocean floor  another 100 feet down which was not accessible back then. Helena believes this is where the Grafikos is) and retrieve a  Grafikos  tablet containing directions to the Dial\'s other half. Helena asks Indy where in history he would go if he got the dial  to which he tearfully replies  back to stop Mutt from enlisting to fight in Vietnam  thus preventing Mutt\'s death and the disintegration of his and Marion\'s marriage.\nVoller arrives and takes over Renaldo\'s boat. The Grafikos tablet has a message written in Polybius Cypher  which Voller cannot understand. He forces Indy to decipher the tablet by killing Renaldo. Helena offers to decipher the tablet for $100 000. Helena translates the instructions to the tomb of Archimedes which has been undiscovered for 2000 years.\nIndy\'s group escapes and heads to Sicily  pursued by Voller. Turns out Helena had misguided Voller  the tomb was not in Alexandria  but in Sicily.Inside the Ear of Dionysius cavern  Indy and Helena find Archimedes\' tomb and the Dial\'s second half. The pair also discover a 20th-century wristwatch on Archimedes\' skeleton and a carving of a phoenix with propellers on his tomb. Voller appears (as he had seen the group heading West and not East to Alexandria) and captures Indy  wounding him. Helena and Teddy escape and chase Voller.\nAfter reassembling the Dial  Voller reveals his plans to time travel back to 1939 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and help lead Germany to victory in World War II. Voller and his team change into their Nazi uniforms to prepare for their time travel.\nAt an airfield  Voller activates the Dial and locates a time fissure in the sky. Indy is held captive on Voller\'s stolen plane (which is also painted in Nazi colors) while Helena stows away through its landing gear. Teddy follows them in another plane.While approaching the fissure  Indy realizes that continental drift could have altered the time-line coordinates. Rather than 1939  the group arrives at the Siege of Syracuse in 214 BC. The warring armies shoot down Voller\'s plane  believing it is a dragon.\nIndy and Helena parachute out just before the plane crashes  killing everyone aboard  while Teddy lands safely. Archimedes investigates the crash and finds Voller\'s body  wristwatch  and the Dial in the wreckage.\nArchimedes tells Indy and Helena that he created the Dial to bring users from the future through fissures that lead only to his time  in order to obtain their assistance in the battle against the overwhelming Roman force. As the fissure begins to collapse  a wounded Indy decides to remain behind  feeling he has nothing to return to. Helena  fearing a time paradox and unwilling to give up on him  knocks Indy unconscious.Back in the present  a recovering Indy awakens in his apartment.

Vampiro gets a Colombian police officer  Jorge  and a wealthy citizen named Paul to help with Tim\'s mission. Tim\'s HSI supervisor  Frost  is unable to provide funding for the operation  and asks him to return. Tim  unwilling to abandon the search for Roc??o  resigns. However  Frost is eventually able to convince the Colombian U.S. Embassy to assist with Tim\'s rescue operation. Undercover  they convince Gisselle to sell them 54 children  successfully arrest all of the conspirators and free the children. However  Roc??o is not with them.After interrogating one of Gisselle\'s associates  Jorge learns that Roc??o was sold as a slave to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  entrenched deep in the Amazon natural region behind enemy territory. Jorge informs Tim that there is no way to retrieve the girl  because the region is largely unmapped jungle wilderness  and any rebel territory is a no-fly zone for the Colombian government. However  Vampiro suggests that doctors can get into the region for medical purposes  which gives Tim the idea to pose as doctors. Jorge reluctantly agrees to the risky operation. Tim and Vampiro attempt to enter enemy territory in disguise  but the rebels refuse to let both of them enter  leaving Tim to complete the mission alone.Tim successfully gains access to the enemy camp where Roc??o is being held. He learns that she is being used as the personal sex slave for the rebel leader  El Alacr??n ( the scorpion )  and is also being forced to mash coca leaves to produce cocaine to fund the rebel war against the Colombian government.

Despite being shot at by the rebels  Tim narrowly manages to save Roc??o and gives her the necklace Miguel gave him earlier. Roc??o is finally returned her to her father and brother  and the family returns to Honduras.An epilogue reveals that Tim Ballard never returned to his career in federal law enforcement. He credits his wife with inspiring him to create Operation Underground Railroad  which continues to save children from sexual slavery to this day  and has convinced the United States Congress to pass laws that require the government to cooperate with foreign countries on sex trafficking investigations. The epilogue also states that there are more people enslaved today than in any other time in history  including when slavery was legal. Many of these slaves are children  and the United States is one of the top consumers of child sex slaves.' , 'Based on the incredible true story.'  'Break the silence. Save the children.'

229.401405,2023,Oppenheimer,100,180,8.4,3761,20230721,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,  In 1945  the first atomic bomb is successfully tested -- a triumph for J. Robert Oppenheimer  director of the Manhatten Project at Los Alamos. The politicians take further decisions about the use of the bomb away from Oppenheimer and the other scientists on the project. President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer wanted Truman to brief Stalin before using it in Japan  but Truman does no such thing. The Soviets are threatened  and Oppenheimer believes that this started the nuclear arms race.Though publicly praised  Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities. He later meets Truman  and after expressing his personal guilt  Truman berates Oppenheimer as he considers himself responsible for the decision to use the bomb. Oppenheimer urges restricting further nuclear weapons development  which Truman dismisses.Rear Admiral Lewis Strauss is a retired Naval officer and high-ranking member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Strauss had recruited Oppenheimer as a scientific advisor to the AEC  after the war was over.As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)  Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy  while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest in the middle of the burgeoning Cold War. Oppenheimer says that a Hydrogen presented insurmountable technical difficulties and should not be pursued. He instead tries to convince the AEC to control the spread of nuclear weapons around the world.AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes (which helped other nations build the Atomic bomb) and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. Oppenheimer suggested that US and Soviets should offer concessions to each other not to pursue a Hydrogen bomb as if US builds one  Soviets will have no choice to build one as well.\nDespite Oppenheimer's objections  Truman green-lights the H-bomb program.\nStrauss believed that Oppenheimer collaborated with the Russians during the Manhattan project  and this is how they were able to produce a bomb in such a short period after the war.Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.In 1954  wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence  Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However  it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Strauss claims that he was the Chairman of the AEC  but the charges against Oppenheimer were brought by William L. Borden (David Dastmalchian)  a lawyer and executive director of the JCAE who wrote to the FBI.\nStrauss claims that Borden was a rabid anti-Communist and had access to Oppenheimer's security file on which he based his claims. It is strongly indicated that Strauss provided Oppenheimer's security file to Borden and used Borden to bring Oppenheimer down.Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited  and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him.\nOppenheimer brought his brother to work on the Manhattan project  and he was a known Communist. This also goes against Oppenheimer. Teller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. Groves supports Oppenheimer. The entire review was done behind closed doors  as an administrative process  with no public hearing and no burden of proof on the prosecution. Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) served as special counsel to the AEC at Oppenheimer's security hearing and was appointed by Strauss. He had full access to Oppenheimer's file while Oppenheimer's attorney didn't have access to his client's file. The board revokes Oppenheimer's Q clearance  damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy.In 1959  during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce  Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall  resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination.In 1963  President Lyndon B. Johnson (Hap Lawrence) presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback reveals Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed his belief that they had indeed started a chain reaction-a nuclear arms race-that would one day destroy the world.  , 'The World Forever Changes'

She admires Jaime's close family relationships  and they nearly kiss before Rudy tells them he has broken into the computer.Rudy finds out that the Scarab once fused with someone else  who was analyzed to create the prototype OMAC suit  but the project with shut down before it could be completed. Once the Scarab chooses a host  it merges with them on a cellular level  and does its best to protect the bearer. Unfortunately  the only way to remove the Scarab is to kill the host. Jaime is disheartened  and Rudy talks with him outside  encouraging him that maybe the Scarab is a gift instead of a curse. They see Victoria's helicopter headed towards the Reyes home  and Jaime races back. Victoria's army of enforcers storm the Reyes house and round up the family  demanding to know where their son is and setting fire to the house. Jaime arrives and the suit withstands their attacks  so they start targeting his family. Jaime defeats most of the soldiers  but Alberto and Milagro are pinned down by a soldier as Victoria and Carapax prepare a special weapon. Jaime and Khaji-Da take out the soldier  but Alberto begins suffering a heart attack  distracting Jaime long enough for Carapax to catch him in an electrified claw that incapacitates him. Carapax abducts Jaime as his father dies before the ambulance can arrive. In the morning  Rocio  Milagro  and Rudy are rallied by Nana to put their grief aside for the time being and save Jaime. Jenny offers to help  and takes them back to her childhood home. She brings them into Ted/Blue Beetle's Bugship  an armored airship  and head out to plan a rescue.Jaime is held prisoner inside an old island fortress near Cuba  where the OMAC is being developed. Victoria plans to download the Scarab's code into the OMAC neural systems  and duplicate it to create thousands of super-soldiers  unconcerned that the process will likely kill Jaime. Her lead scientist argues that they could learn more from the Scarab if they keep the host alive  but Victoria orders him to start extracting the Scarab's code into Carapax. Meanwhile  Jenny leads the Reyes family to the island  where Nana formulates a plan to storm the base using Kord's old tech. They land the ship amidst heavy fire  converting it into a walking tank-like vehicle  and blaze through the enforcers' ranks. Milagro heads into the labyrinthine tunnels with Jenny to find her brother. They duck into a side room to avoid the guards  and find that Victoria has already constructed thousands of OMAC units waiting for hosts  which are being powered up by the Scarab. In the lab  Jaime is put through excruciating pain from download  and his organs start to shut down. As he passes out  he sees a vision of Alberto  who encourages him to embrace his destiny and accept the Scarab instead of fighting against it. Jaime says goodbye to his dad  and reaches out to Khaji-Da while Jenny and Milagro place explosives on the generator. Jaime fully merges with the Scarab as the explosives go off  shutting down the extraction  but not before Carapax's OMAC suit is fully powered and operational. Jaime escapes his restraints  but the Scarab needs time to reboot. He is helped by the scientist  who is killed by Carapax in his newly transformed suit. Jaime runs  but is cornered by soldiers. Nana arrives and eliminates the enforcers  expertly operating a machine gun  and revealing she used to be a revolutionary in her youth. They make it back to the ship  but Milagro and Jenny have not returned  so Jaime goes back in to find them  along with Rudy. The explosion has separated the two girls  and Jenny is captured by Victoria and her guards. Milagro is pinned down  but Jaime finds her just in time. Now completely symbiotic with the Scarab  he easily takes down the soldiers and saves his sister  but is found and engaged by Carapax. A fierce fight ensues  Jaime eventually being beaten down by the bigger  stronger warrior. Rudy emerges and Carapax sends a rocket after him  seemingly killing him. Enraged  Jaime gains the upper hand  and prepares to take revenge for his father and uncle and kill Carapax  but is forcibly stopped by the Scarab. Now understanding compassion since merging with Jaime  it tells him what it saw upon being briefly downloaded into Ignacio's own mind  showing that he was conscripted as a child soldier as a young boy  how Victoria found him and took him to be her guinea pig for the OMAC project  and how his mother was killed by a random and senseless bomb attack  turning him into the cold hearted man he became. Jaime takes pity on him  and spares his life. Meanwhile  Victoria attempts to escape in a helicopter with Jenny in tow  showing her that even though if she loses the island facility  she has the Scarab's code in a portable device  and can start over. Jenny uses a protective foam gadget her dad left her to take out the pilots and throw herself and Victoria out of the helicopter to the ground safely. Jenny destroys the duplicated Scarab code  and Victoria orders Carapax to kill them. However  Carapax turns on her as the others escape  reuniting with a very much alive Rudy. Carapax overloads his suit  taking Victoria  the fortress  and all of the OMAC units with him as it explodes.The Reyes family grieve for Alberto  and the community rallies around them for support. Jenny takes over as CEO of Kord Industries  and promises to uphold her father's legacy. She gives Rudy a new truck  and tells them she will have her company rebuild the Rayes' home. Jenny says she is heading to her father's mansion  and Jaime offers to fly her there  and they share a kiss.Deep within the Blue Beetle's lair  a garbled transmission from Ted Kord desperately tells his daughter that he is still alive.  ,  He's a superhero  whether he likes it or not.    He's the first superhero in his family.   'Hungry for a hero?'

Kanzunori wanted to make racing accessible to all.Following a pitch by marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom)  Nismo  the motor-sport division of Nissan establishes the GT Academy to recruit skilled players of the racing simulator Gran Turismo and turn them into real racing drivers. Danny believes that 80 million youth play the Gran Tourismo. If he can convert one of them into a racing champion  that would open up a whole new category for their physical cars.Danny recruits former driver-turned-mechanic Jack Salter (David Harbour) to train the players. Jack is initially hesitant but accepts after tiring of the arrogance of his team\'s driver  Nicholas Capa (Josha Stradowski). Jack believes that putting a kid from behind his console into a 200 mile an hour rocket is dangerous  but Danny is convinced that the kids have more track time than any of the professional racers.\nMeanwhile  Jann Mardenborough (Archie Madekwe)  a teenage clothing store employee and gamer from Cardiff  Wales  is an avid player of the simulator and wants to become a racing driver  despite the disapproval of his former footballer father Steve Mardenborough (Djimon Hounsou). Jann argues that racing cars is what he is good at  it\'s what he loves.One day  Jann learns he is eligible for a qualification race to join the GT Academy after setting a time record for a particular track. The night before his race  Jann is invited by his brother Coby to a party  and the brothers take their father\'s car. Jann flirts with a young woman named Audrey (Maeve Courtier-Lilley) whom he develops a crush on.\nThe gathering is disbanded after police arrive  and Jann initiates a pursuit after driving away when their friends are pulled over. The brothers escape but are caught returning by their father. Coby (Daniel Puig) starts to worry  but Jann offers to take the blame for him if he admits that he is the better driver. Jann is taken to his father\'s place of employment the next morning in an attempt to be taught a life lesson (Steve says that either Jann gets an education  or he joins Steve at the rail-yard since he has no other plans. Steve says that there is no future in racing)  but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race  which he wins  earning a place in GT Academy.At the academy camp in Silverstone UK  Jack puts the competitors (Including Jann  Matty  Antonio  Frederick  Leah Vega (Emelia Hartford)  Joo-Hwan Lee (Sang Heon Lee)  Klaus Hoffman (Max Mundt)  Henry Evas (Mariano Gonz??lez)  Avi Bhatt (Harki Bhambra)  Chloe McCormick (Lindsay Pattison)  Marcel Durand (Th??o Christine))through their paces in various tests  through which ten competitors are narrowed down to five.\nDuring one of which  Jann crashes with Jack in the car and claims the brakes were glazed  later proven correct by analysts  to Jack\'s surprise. The remaining five compete in a final race to determine who will represent Nissan. Jann narrowly wins the race against American competitor Matty Davis (Darren Barnet)  but Danny insists Matty should be chosen as the representative due to his better commercial viability and due to Jann not being press ready and awkward in front of the camera. However  Jann is chosen at Jack\'s insistence.Jann is told that if he finishes at least fourth in any one of a series of qualifying races  he will earn a professional license and contract with Nissan. He finishes last in his first professional race in Austria after Nicholas taps him into a spin  and despite gradually improving over the next few races  he does not finish the penultimate race in Spain. He travels to Dubai for his last qualifying race  during which Nicholas takes a corner too fast and crashes. Despite the debris from this crash cracking his windshield  Jann achieves a fourth-place finish and earns his license. He then travels to Tokyo with Danny and Jack to sign his contract and uses his signing bonus to fly Audrey to Tokyo. During this time  they initiate a relationship.Jann\'s first race after signing is at the N??rburgring Nordschleife. He starts the race well and maintains a high position until the front of his car lifts into the air at the Flugplatz corner  hitting a barrier and launching into a crowded spectator area. Jann is airlifted to the N??rburgring Medical Center and is informed while in hospital that a spectator was killed in the crash  much to his horror. Reluctant to return to racing and blaming himself for the spectator\'s death  Jack takes him back to the N??rburgring  during which he reveals he was involved in a fatal accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans  which led to a fellow driver dying and his retirement from driving.\nAn inquiry clears Jann of any wrongdoing  but professional sentiment begins to turn against sim drivers. In response  Danny decides a sim driver team should compete at Le Mans and finish on the podium to prove their viability.Danny enlists Matty and fellow GT Academy participant Antonio Cruz (Pepe Barroso) to make up the three-driver team alongside Jann. On race day  Jann\'s father apologizes for not initially being supportive of his passions. Early in the race  Jann is left shaken after Frederik Schulin\'s (Niall McShea) car crashes and catches fire  but is encouraged through his first shift by Jack playing  Songbird  and  Orinoco Flow  through the car\'s communication system  which Jann had previously used as motivational music during training.\nMatty and Antonio complete their first shifts without issue  but the latter is brought in from his last session early due to experiencing cramps. A wheel nut is dropped by mechanic Felix (Richard Cambridge) during the pit stop  causing Jann to lose several positions. He deviates from advised racing lines he learned from playing Gran Turismo to regain his positions  breaking the competition lap record in the process. The final lap sees Jann pitted against Nicholas  with Jann once again narrowly in front on the final straight to earn third place and a podium finish for Nissan.In the epilogue  the real Jann Mardenborough is shown having competed in over 200 races and served as his own stunt double in the film.' , 'From gamer to racer.'

While leaving the winery  Robert is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent grandson. Robert considers suicide due to his injury  but finds his gun out of bullets and then takes the ferry to go back to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast  Robert pulls over and slips into unconsciousness from shock  where he is found and rescued by Gio Bonucci (Eugenio Mastrandrea)  a local Carabiniere.Bonucci brings him to a remote coastal Italian town called Altamonte  where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). Robert gets acquainted with the locals and becomes fond of the town and its people. Robert makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) to tip her off about the winery's role in the illegal drug trade disguised as normal business transactions in Sicily. Collins and other CIA operatives arrive at the winery and find millions in cash along with bags of Fenethylline tablets hidden in a storeroom  confirming Robert's suspicions.Meanwhile  the members of the Camorra harass and kill villagers in an attempt to coerce them out of their housing and take over Altamonte for commercialization purposes. Robert overhears Marco Quaranta (Andrea Dodero)  a high-ranking Camorra member  pressurizing local store owner Angelo (Daniele Perrone) for payments. To make an example  the Camorra firebombs Angelo's fish store as the entire town watches. Bonucci reviews video of the firebombing and calls the Italian central police for an inquiry. Along with his wife and daughter  Bonucci is later attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations.\nMeanwhile Collins has tracked Robert to Altamonte and knows that Robert was behind the killings at the vineyard. Robert wants Collins to find why Lorenzo was using Silicy as his base for the drug smuggling operations from Middle East into Europe. As such  Silicy is the most heavily guarded port in the region.Sometime after  Marco demands that Bonucci set up a boat for them; overhearing them  Robert requests them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses  Robert kills him and his henchmen.\nMeanwhile a Rome station is bombed by Syrian terrorists  and Collins finds that the drug money from Lorenzo was funding their activities in Italy. She figures that the Syrians are in Sicily and hence were routing the drugs through that Island.\nWith the help of the local police  Collins starts hunting down cells of terrorists on Sicily.The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Vincent (Andrea Scarduzio)  Marco's brother and head of the Camorra  to find the person behind Marco's death. The Head of Police knew that Vincent was buying the drugs from the Syrians and funding their attacks on his own people. He tells Vincent about Collins who is soon going to figure out Vincent's operations.Vincent has Collins' car rigged with a bomb  but she survives after Robert warns her.\nVincent later threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town if Robert does not reveal himself. Robert does  but before Vincent can kill him  the citizens begin to record the ordeal  causing Vincent and the rest of the Camorra to retreat with plans to retaliate the following day.Later that night  Robert infiltrates Vincent's home and stealthily kills his bodyguards. Then  Robert forces Vincent to take a lethal dose of his own drugs to kill him. Through Collins  Robert returns the money he had taken from the winery to an elderly couple's pension fund. This couple's pension fund was hacked and the money stolen by Lorenzo.\nBack in Langley  Virginia  Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. She receives a package containing a book of contacts and note from Robert congratulating her  and declaring her mother would be proud of her - revealing Collins to be the daughter of Robert's longtime friend and colleague Susan Plummer.

While investigating a disturbance  Noiret is raised into the air  set on fire  and burned to death  all the while Jacques watches as he holds onto the priest's rosary.Following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery  Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France  where he has made friends with a young Irish girl named Sophie  as well as a teacher and her mother  Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him  and the next day  she is asked by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe. While Irene travels to Tarascon  Sister Debra  a young novice  joins her without permission. During the train ride  Debra expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles  such as the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist  while Irene explains to her the importance of faith.At Tarascon  Irene has a vision where she follows Jacques into an alley but ends up getting choked by Valak  the demon who takes the form of a nun. The next morning  Debra tells Irene that she had met with Jacques and he had given her Father Noiret's rosary. At the same time  in the boarding school  Sophie is bullied by her classmates and locked up in the abandoned chapel of the school where no-one is allowed to enter. The bullies tell her to look at a window with a goat on the mosaic  and claim that if she looks away  the devil will appear to haunt her. The sun shines through the mosaic and makes the eye of the goat shine red.Irene and Debra travel to Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian who tells them that the demon they are investigating was an angel rejected by God and that the emblem on the rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy  who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire by the pagan  she miraculously did not die; St. Lucy's family rescued her eyes and dispersed throughout the world. The librarian suggests that the demon is killing the descendants of St. Lucy because it wants this relic  the eyes  which were last known to be stored in a former monastery  which is revealed to be a boarding school in the present day.Irene and Debra go to the school to find Maurice in distress with Sophie and Kate. Irene tells Maurice that the demon is inside of him  and is devastated by the revelation  but is then taken over by the demon and attacks Irene and Debra  before being knocked unconscious. Inside the chapel of the school  Sophie shows Irene  Debra  and Kate the game her classmates made her play and Debra uses a flashlight to make the eyes of the goat on the mosaic glow red.

Under the influence of the demon  Maurice escapes and attacks Irene  while Sophie grabs the relic and runs away. Maurice chases after Sophie and causes the bell tower building to collapse. Irene finds Sophie inside  and Debra reunites with the pair. Debra admits that she has seen a miracle and has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice until he manages to hold it himself. He lifts Irene in the air and sets her on fire  but she does not burn as she realizes that she is a descendant of St. Lucy and is able to harness the same power associated with the relic.Irene and Debra begin to pray the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and barrels of wine present at the former monastery become the blood of Christ. As the blood of Christ soaks Valak  the demon perishes and is damned back to hell.  , 'The greatest evil in The Conjuring Universe.'  'Confess your sins.'

He has retired from detective work and currently lives in post-World War 2 Venice  but people continue to hound him for help in solving mysteries due to his past reputation (as referenced in the previous films \'Murder on the Orient Express\' and \'Death on the Nile\'). Poirot is now accompanied by a bodyguard  former police officer Vitale Portfoglio (Riccardo Scarmacio)  who keeps the people from pestering him.One day  Poirot is visited by an old friend  named Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey). She is an author whose last few books have not seen much success. Ariadne invites Poirot to attend a Halloween party at a palazzo belonging to former opera singer Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly). The main event will be a seance performed by renowned medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh)  described in the press as  The Unholy Mrs. Reynolds .Poirot and Vitale accompany Ariadne across the canal as they arrive at the palazzo. A group of children are there  being told a story about how the palazzo used to be an orphanage  but the doctors and nurses abandoned the children to die there during the Plague  leading to the belief that the spirits of the children haunt the palazzo. There is said to be a curse  the Children\'s Vendetta  and any victim is marked with a slash on them as a sign. One of the children  Leopold (Jude Hill)  is taken care of by the housemaid  Olga Seminoff (Camille Cottin)  as he does not join the other children and prefers to read a Poe book. Leopold goes to see his nervous father  Dr. Leslie Ferrier (Jamie Dornan). Poirot and Ariadne see Rowena  and Ariadne notes that the previous year  Rowena lost her daughter Alicia (Rowan Robinson) in what is believed to be a suicide after she fell from the balcony. Because of this  Rowena has had trouble selling the palazzo. Olga and Dr. Ferrier also feel a sense of loss since they knew and cared for Alicia as well.Joyce arrives to the palazzo  accompanied by her assistant Desdemona Holland (Emma Laird). Arriving seemingly uninvited is Alicia\'s ex-fiance Maxime Gerard (Kyle Allen). Rowena and Ferrier clearly don\'t like him but he claims someone else invited him.The seance begins with everyone gathered in a circle  and Joyce sitting in the middle. Olga tells Poirot that before her death  Alicia had begun to see hallucinations of the dead children. Joyce appears to be channeling Alicia\'s spirit  with any indication of her communication coming from keys seemingly being pressed on a typewriter. Poirot cuts the charade by revealing a second assistant in the chimney  Desdemona\'s half brother Nicholas (Ali Khan)  who was flipping a switch to make the typewriter keys press automatically. Then  Joyce begins to spin around and make horrific noises and motions  before talking to Rowena with what sounds like Alicia\'s voice  which frightens some of the guests.Poirot attempts to leave  despite Ariadne\'s protests. He then talks to Joyce  who says that it would be easier and less painful for her if she was a fraud  but she knows that Poirot has seen enough death to understand her. She puts her mask on him along with her robe and encourages him to lighten up. Poirot then goes by the pot where the children were bobbing for apples  and he attempts to do so himself  only for an unseen figure to push his head into the water in an attempt to drown him  but the culprit flees before Poirot loses consciousness. He is found by Vitale  and they then hear a scream. Outside  Joyce\'s body falls and is impaled on a statue\'s hand.A storm begins outside  flooding the canals and ensuring that nobody can leave the palazzo. The guests begin to panic and grow paranoid  believing that there might be a supernatural force that killed Joyce. Poirot locks everyone inside and begins to suspect that one of them murdered her. Poirot brings Ariadne with him to begin to interview the suspects. They find a stuffed rabbit called Baba that belonged to Alicia  which had previously been missing.Poirot and Ariadne begin by speaking to Olga  then Dr. Ferrier  who suffers from PTSD and is haunted by his time at the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp due to his guilt over not being able to save the victims of that time. He says that him taking on Alicia was a favor to Rowena because he was in love with Rowena.Poirot excuses himself to go to the bathroom  where he believes he sees Alicia\'s ghost in the mirror behind him. He finds Leopold outside  who tells him he is jumpy like Dr. Ferrier  and the boy claims to hear the voices of the ghost children.Poirot and Ariadne then interview Nicholas and Desdemona separately to get unbiased accounts. They give their accounts of the evening  as well as their history being Romani refugees trying to make it to America. Poirot also learns that the siblings stole from Joyce and were possibly threatened by her. Desdemona attempts to make a run for it after punching Vitale  but Olga trips her and knocks her down.The phone in the foyer begins to ring  but when Poirot and Vitale answer  there is nobody on the other end. Poirot then appears to see one of the ghost children  until Ariadne calls him and he finds nobody after turning his head back. He also thinks he hears the sound of a child singing  which Leopold also claims to hear. Poirot thinks it is coming from the basement  but Rowena says there is no basement in the house.The group moves downstairs and finds a hidden room  with the word  dottore  (Italian for \'doctor\') written on the wall  further alluding to the Children\'s Vendetta. Dr. Ferrier begins to have a panic attack  and when Maxime tells him to keep it together  they get into a fight until Ferrier almost kills Maxime before Leopold calms him down. Ferrier goes to lie down in the music room and is locked inside  with Poirot having the only key. Poirot and Ariadne then speak to Maxime  who has a half of a ripped picture of Alicia. He claims he had to break off his engagement to her because Rowena did not approve of him  and Alicia seemed desperate to keep her mother happy.Poirot inspects the invitation that Maxime received  decoding the word  apple  from it. When Ariadne showed up at his home  she brought an apple with her. Poirot confronts her and Vitale  saying he has figured out that they conspired with Joyce to bring him to the palazzo. Vitale was the officer that pulled Alicia out of the canal and investigated her death  so he knew the ins and outs of the palazzo  while Ariadne was hoping to use the seance and Poirot\'s inability to solve it as the basis for her new story. Ariadne admits to him that she needed a good new story after a string of flops. Desdemona then bursts in and tells Poirot to hurry with the key.The group finds Ferrier dead with a knife in his back. Leopold is devastated at the sight. After the group disperses  Olga talks to Poirot and says that Rowena was always by Alicia\'s side before her death  but prior to it  Olga heard voices coming from her room. Poirot then looks at photos of Alicia and notices one of her as a little girl  the same little girl he thought he saw in the house earlier. He also notices a specific type of flower in one of the pictures. In another brief state of delusion  Poirot turns around as the house\'s pet parrot knocks over a teacup. Poirot goes to clean it up and then finds the other half of Maxime\'s picture  which is of himself and Alicia.Poirot then gathers the guests together  as he has solved the mystery. The killer is none other than Rowena herself. Poirot explains that Rowena had planted rhododendrons in her garden and extracted a honey from it that she used to drug Alicia  keeping her under care against her will following her returning after breaking things off with Maxime. The honey also caused hallucinations  which made Alicia believe that she saw the ghost children  and it is the same honey that Poirot earlier consumed with tea and made him see ghosts too. When Alicia was having a psychotic break  Olga administered more honey because she believed it was calming to her  but she accidentally gave her a fatal overdose. Rowena threw Alicia\'s body into the canal and staged it as a suicide. The revelation causes Olga to feel extreme guilt. Rowena later learned she was being blackmailed and suspected either Joyce or Ferrier. She was the one who attempted to drown Poirot  believing it was Joyce since he was wearing her mask and robe. When she did find Joyce  she pushed her off the balcony to her death  and she used a hand rake to mark her back with the so-called Children\'s Vendetta  as she did with Alicia. But since Rowena was nowhere near Ferrier when he died  Poirot explains this as her finding out that he blackmailed her  and she threatened Leopold\'s life unless he did what she said  so Ferrier walked backwards into a knife to spare his son. Poirot figures that Rowena was hoping that blaming the deaths on ghosts would get her off easy.Rowena begins to make a run for it. Poirot pursues her to the balcony  where she aims a weapon at him. A flash of thunder strikes  and Poirot sees what looks like Alicia\'s ghost appear behind Rowena. The ghost then seems to pull Rowena down  sending her plunging into the canal to her death.In the morning  the canal clears up  and the guests begin to leave. Poirot and Ariadne have one last conversation before parting ways  apparently forever. Olga adopts Leopold  and Poirot learns that he was the blackmailer after deducing that Rowena was making a poison. He had also been trying to support his father by using the money Rowena sent from the blackmail.Poirot returns to his home  having his faith somewhat restored. A man that earlier approached him comes into his home  hoping for Poirot to solve the deaths of his parents and brother. Poirot already deduced from minor facts that the family doctor was involved in the hopes of earning their inheritance  and the great detective jumps on the case.' , 'Death is just the beginning'

GameStop had managed to stay open during Covid by classifying itself as essential services and made a loss of $ 632 million in the previous year. Gabe tells Ken that this is sure shot deal  as the stock is being propped up by Retail traders or  Dumb Money This is when online stock buyers  including struggling nurse Jennifer (America Ferrera)  GameStop retail employee Marcos (Anthony Ramos)  and lesbian college couple Riri (Myha\'La Herrold) and Harmony (Talia Ryder)  start aggressively buying stock based on Keith\'s advice.\nThese retail investors place their orders through a stock platform called Robinhood.This causes Plotkin and other investment CEOs to lose hundreds of millions within the same time-frame and Keith to be heralded as a financial guru. GameStop stock price reaches $65. Keith makes $11 million in notional profit.\nKeith decides not to sell  prompting his followers not to sell either. The stock reaches a $123 and Gabe panics as he has lost $ 6.8 billion on his short positions that he needs to now cover.\nGabe has to get Ken and Steve Cohen (Vincent D\'Onofrio) from Point72 to invest in Melvin to keep it afloat.At this point there are 8 million retail stockholders of GameStop  and they all hold their stock as Keith decided to hold even after being up $23 million. Stock surges to $350/share and attracts attention of even the White House. It is the rich people vs the poor people and the poor people are winning for a change. Keith is up $47 million.\nThings take a turn when r/WallStreetBets is temporarily shut down for  inflammatory and vulgar content   causing a mass surge of panic selling in GameStop\'s stock in an attempt to beat a perceived price drop. Keith is told by MassMutual to either resign or he will be fired.The commission-free stock trading website Robinhood (founded by Baiju Bhatt (Rushi Kota) & Vlad Tenev (Sebastian Stan)) is unable to adequately pay the money for the sales  which amounted to $3 Billion.\nCo-chairman Vlad Tenev (Sebastian Stan)  at the behest of Citadel LLC owner Ken Griffin (Nick Offerman)  halts all buying of GameStop\'s stock (by graying out the buy option) in an attempt to drive down the price.\nEven though Robinhood\'s customers are retail traders  but Robinhood routes all their trades through Citadel  who offers them a tiny discount on every trade  which adds up. So  even though Robinhood was supposed to be an independent platform  in reality it was funded by Citadel.The play ultimately works (as the stock price drops from $483 to $140)  but the subsequent negative backlash results in an investigation by the United States House Committee on Financial Services  with Tenev  Griffin  Plotkin  and Keith all being subpoenaed  the former three for their roles in the fiasco and the latter on suspicion of using the situation to trick the public into making himself rich.\nThe interrogation takes place on Feb 18th  2021. As the investors struggle to defend their actions  Keith adamantly denies any wrongdoing  stating he was only doing what anyone with a passing awareness of investment banking would do in that situation.Meanwhile the Robinhood platform and WallStreetBets platforms are back up and all retail traders find that Keith held his position in GameStop and start buying stock again.In the aftermath  post text shows how several of the individuals were affected:\nPlotkin was forced to shut down Melvin Capital because of the net losses the incident caused;\nRobinhood was the target of several lawsuits following the fiasco and wound up starting in the stock market significantly lower than it was prior;\nHarmony was able to use the money she obtained to pay off her family\'s debt issues and continues her relationship with Riri;\nMarcos sold half of his GameStop stock and quit his position in the company;\nJennifer remains in debt but has retained her shareholding;Keith retired from YouTube in late April to get out of the public eye and sold part of his stocks to get Kevin an expensive car as a way to stop his nagging about how he will not loan him his car for his food deliveries.\nNo charges were filed against anyone by the SEC. Now  85% of the hedge funds scour the internet to see where the retail traders are putting their money. Wall Street never ignored Dumb Money again.' , 'Dear Wall Street...'

Rahmat and his forces had attacked an old chemical factory which was operational under Gaddafi\'s regime  but now is being used as a makeshift storage facility for his nuclear accessories  guarded by factions of the Libyan army.\nRahmat\'s private army is very well equipped and even has air cover from predatory drones. The Libyan forces are no match for Rahmat.CIA operative Marsh sends in the Expendables to retrieve the nuclear detonators. Marsh says that Ocelot is planning an international incident by pairing the detonators with nuclear warheads. Many years ago  the CIA hired Barney to expose Ocelot\'s identity. But Ocelot ambushed Barney and almost killed his entire team. Rumors persisted that Barney created the myth of Ocelot to bury his own mistakes.The Expendables team is led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and formed by members Lee Christmas (Jason Statham)  Toll Road (Randy Couture)  and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren)  with new members Easy Day (Curtis  50 Cent  Jackson) and Galan (Jacob Scipio).\nAs soon as the Expendable\'s plane enters Libyan airspace  they are shot at with SAMs. Barney manages to land his plane  deploy the ground teams and takes off into the air again. Their age shows as Jensen takes 2 shots at Rahmat with his sniper rifle and misses due to his poor eyesight. However  they are incapacitated when all of their vehicles are destroyed in the ensuing fight.\nWhen Barney\'s plane runs out of flares  Christmas tries to save Barney by abandoning pursuit of Rahmat and taking out the SAM sites targeting Barney\'s plane.\nWhen Rahmat shoots their plane down with a large caliber gun  the team finds what appears to be Barney\'s burned corpse in the wreckage  identified solely by his ring.\nRahmat escapes with the detonators in a helicopter.At Barney\'s memorial service  CIA operative Marsh (Andy Garc??a) reveals that the team will pursue Ocelot and Rahmat  but without Christmas  who jeopardized the mission trying to save Barney.\nChristmas is replaced by Gina (Megan Fox)  his former lover  who also brings an operative named Lash (Levy Tran) into the team. The team travels to Asia to stop Rahmat from taking delivery of the other nuclear materials to assemble a warhead  but is secretly tracked by Christmas  who had slipped Gina a tracking device earlier. Barney\'s apparent death opened a sealed file which states that there is an eyewitness that could identify Ocelot. Marsh now knows the identity of the witness.Marsh says Ocelot plans to provoke World War III by letting the nuclear warheads explode in the Russian Far East  transporting them on a ship disguised as an American aircraft carrier. As the Expendables and Marsh board the ship  they are ambushed and taken hostage. Marsh is taken away to negotiate a prisoner-exchange for the eyewitness. Rahmat offers to release Marsh in exchange for the witness who can identify Ocelot.Meanwhile  Christmas travels to Thailand to recruit former Expendable Decha (Tony Jaa)  who has turned towards pacifism but agrees to bring him to the ship to avenge Barney. As Christmas fights his way through the ship  Decha has a change of heart and helps him rescue the rest of the team. The team finds a nuclear bomb on board and the only way to disarm it is with a kill switch which works on a short range only. The team speculates that Rahmat would have the kill switch on his person.They launch an attack on Rahmat\'s forces  during which Christmas fights and kills him. Before dying Rahmat says that he does not have the kill switch and only Ocelot has it. However  Toll has been heavily wounded and needs immediate medical care.During the prisoner exchange  Marsh is revealed to be Ocelot when he kills the witness  hoping to financially profit from igniting World War III. The ship was headed for Russian waters where detonating the warhead would be perceived as an act of war against the Russian people by the Americans.Christmas starts by blowing up the helicopter on which the witness was brought in on the ship  and which was Marsh\'s escape vehicle.\nMarsh responds by throwing the detonator in the ocean which makes sure that the bomb is going off. While the team leaves on Decha\'s boat (which was being towed behind the ship) to save Toll  Christmas stays behind to turn the ship around to avoid a global conflict by steering the ship out of Russian waters.Marsh directs all of his remaining forces to the bridge to try and turn the ship back around. But all the soldiers are neutralized by a mysterious helicopter gunship.\nChristmas confronts Marsh  who is killed by Barney  who surprises everyone by revealing that he faked his death  hoping to lure Ocelot out of hiding. Barney rescues Christmas off the ship and then blows the ship apart forcing it to sink under the water.\nThey escape the nuclear explosion on the helicopter and celebrate with the team.' ,  They'll Die When They're Dead   'Old blood meets new blood.'

In response  most of the Western nations wage war against AI to prevent humanity\'s extinction; they are being resisted by people of the so-called New Asia (consisting of Southeast Asia  Japan  Taiwan  Bangladesh  Bhutan  Nepal and parts of India) who continue to embrace AI. The military seeks to assassinate  Nirmata   the mysterious chief architect behind the AI advancements. The USS NOMAD (North American Orbital Mobile Aerospace Defense) is developed as an advanced space station capable of launching destructive attacks from orbit.U.S. Army sergeant Joshua Taylor is an undercover operative with his pregnant wife Maya Fey  whom the military believes to be the daughter of Nirmata. When military forces attack their home  exposing Taylor as a covert agent seeking to use Maya to find Nirmata  Maya runs away but is hit by a subsequent NOMAD strike.Five years later  Taylor works as part of the ground zero cleanup crew in Los Angeles. He is approached by General Andrews and Colonel Howell to join a mission to destroy a new weapon engineered by Nirmata   Alpha O   believed to be capable of destroying NOMAD and thus shifting the balance of the war in favor of AI. To recruit him  they play a video showing Maya alive  and suggest he might find and reunite with her if he joins the team. In New Asia  separated from the rest of the strike team  Taylor manages to enter the compound believed to hold the weapon but discovers only a robotic  simulant  in the form of a young girl. It is revealed that the girl has the ability to remotely control technology. Dubbing her  Alphie   Taylor disobeys Howell\'s orders to kill Alphie and the two travel to find Drew  Taylor\'s former commanding officer.Examining Alphie  Drew tells Taylor she is capable of becoming the most powerful weapon on the planet as her abilities to control technology will grow exponentially. New Asian police attack Drew\'s apartment  killing his simulant girlfriend Kami  as Howell and squad member McBride close in. With Drew\'s help  Taylor locates Maya\'s beacon but does not find her before being attacked  and Drew is fatally wounded protecting him. Before Drew dies  he tells Taylor that the raid five years earlier had happened because of intelligence gathered that Maya was Nirmata. Taylor and Alphie are captured by New Asian forces led by Harun  a simulant soldier and former ally of Taylor\'s.Harun states that the detonation in Los Angeles was caused by a human coding error  and that the U.S. government unfairly cast the blame on AI  who only wish to peacefully co-exist with humanity. After escaping his captors  Taylor rescues Alphie and prepares to flee as Howell leads an attack on the village. Alphie intervenes with her abilities but is gravely wounded by McBride. She is rushed to Maya  who Taylor learns has been in a coma since the strike on her home  tended to by simulant monks. Because simulants cannot harm Nirmata  she is  stranded  and unable to die. It is also revealed that Alphie was based on Taylor and Maya\'s unborn daughter  who had been scanned in utero. Distressed  Taylor takes Maya off life support as Howell and her forces arrive. They are killed by Harun  who tells Taylor NOMAD must be destroyed in order for the war to end.Taylor and Alphie are captured by U.S. forces and taken to Los Angeles  where Taylor is forced to kill Alphie with an electro magnetic pulse weapon. However  Andrews later discovers this to be a ruse  and the pair escape before Alphie can be incinerated. Boarding a lunar shuttle at the Los Angeles Interplanetary Air and Space Port  Alphie forces the spacecraft to land aboard NOMAD just as Andrews orders a large-scale assault on remaining AI bases across the globe. Taylor plants a timed explosive while Alphie disables the ship\'s power. Before Taylor can arrive at the escape pod  Andrews activates a tentacled robot that prevents him from entering  and Taylor is forced to eject the vehicle with Alphie in it. As NOMAD explodes  halting the strike  Taylor embraces a simulant bearing Maya\'s likeness  whom Alphie had activated using a memory chip containing information Howell had downloaded from Maya\'s brain just after she died. Taylor spends his last few moments with Maya as NOMAD explodes  killing them both  while Alphie returns to Earth and witnesses the people celebrating NOMAD\'s destruction while cheering her as Nirmata.' , 'Humanity evolves.'

While John is at the hospital  he notices a custodian (Isan Beomhyun Lee) attempting to steal a patient\'s belongings. The custodian later wakes up in a trap set up by John  his hand caught in a mechanical contraption and two vacuum tubes hooked up to his eyes. He has 60 seconds to turn a dial that will activate the contraption  breaking all five fingers on his right hand one by one  or else his eyes will be sucked out by the vacuum tubes. He only manages to break three of his fingers before the timer runs out and he gets his eyes vacuumed out  however  the trap sequence is revealed to have taken place entirely in John\'s imagination  and the custodian puts back the patient\'s belongings after noticing John watching him.At a support group meeting for cancer patients  John comes across Henry Kessler (Michael Beach)  who claims to have terminal cancer and vows to keep fighting it until the end. Four months pass  and a bereft John is sitting in a coffee shop  about to sign his last will and testament  when he encounters a seemingly much healthier Henry  who claims to have been cured by an experimental cancer treatment given by Norwegian doctor Dr. Finn Pederson (Donagh Gordon). After doing some research  John finds the website of Pederson\'s daughter  Dr. Cecilia Pederson (Synn??ve Macody Lund)  who is continuing her father\'s work and claims that corrupt pharmaceutical companies have been going after him  thus forcing her to perform further clinical trials of the treatment off the grid. John gets in touch with Cecilia  who refers him to her makeshift clinic in Mexico City for a surgery in two week\'s time.John travels to Mexico City and  upon arriving  is given a tour of the city by taxi driver Diego (Joshua Okamoto)  who takes him to the facility  located in a remote location just outside the city boundaries. He is introduced to Gabriela (Renata Vaca)  who claims to have been cured by Cecilia\'s treatment  as well as Cecilia and the rest of her medical team: nurse Valentina (Paulette Hernandez)  anesthesiologist Mateo (Octavio Hinojosa) and surgeon Dr. Cortez. As Cecilia takes John to the operating room  located within an abandoned chemical factory  he encounters a young boy  Carlos (Jorge Brise??o)  playing with a soccer ball outside the facility. Before his surgery  John speaks with Parker Sears (Steven Brand)  who has just undergone a similar operation. Cecilia and her team conduct the surgery on John  and he awakens to find Cecilia congratulating him and assuring him that the surgery was successful. Believing himself to be cured of his cancer and finding a new lease on life  John fixes Carlos\' bicycle before purchasing a bottle of tequila as a gift for Gabriela. Upon returning to the facility to present the gift  John finds the operating theatre abandoned and in a state of disarray. John realizes that the surgery never actually took place  his brain tumor was never removed and the experimental treatment was an elaborate scam.After figuring out that  Dr. Cortez  was Diego in disguise  John abducts the taxi driver. Diego wakes up back in the facility with John watching over him as his test begins. Diego has two pipe bombs wired into his arms and he must use two scalpels attached to his hands to cut through his flesh in order to remove the explosives. Diego survives his test and gives up information about the rest of the con artists. Meanwhile  while closing up his veterinarian\'s office  Mateo sells drugs to a desperate Gabriela  before he is abducted moments afterward by an assailant in a pig mask. The same assailant kidnaps Valentina while she is being assaulted by a stranger in his car  before going on to kidnap Gabriela from a nightclub bathroom and Cecilia from her home as she tries to escape in her car. The kidnapper removes their mask moments before Cecilia is abducted  revealing themselves to be Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith)  John\'s apprentice  with both her and John working together to kidnap Cecilia.Valentina  Cecilia  Mateo and Gabriela all wake up back in the disused factory they had used as the facility for their fraudulent activities  finding themselves in a deadly game overseen by John and Amanda. Valentina is the first to be tested  tasked with amputating her own leg with a Gigli saw and extracting an amount of bone marrow from her body. While she succeeds in cutting off her leg  she fails to extract the bone marrow in time and is subsequently decapitated by a wire. Cecilia\'s phone  located on a trolley  starts ringing  but is out of reach from everyone. Cecilia then disembowels Valentina\'s corpse and uses her intestines as a rope to pull the trolley close enough to reach her phone  making a call to someone and revealing she\'s been kidnapped but being interrupted when Amanda gives her an electric shock. Amanda  having struggled with drug addict herself in the past  expresses apprehensive over the prospect of Gabriela being tested. Mateo is the next to be tested  being tasked with cutting into his own skull and removing a piece of his own cerebral tissue and place it into a container of enzyme fluid in order to deactivate his trap. He removes a piece of brain matter successfully  however  it is not dissolved by the enzyme in time to release him  resulting in his death when a mask closes around his face and burns it.During the games  Parker returns to the compound  armed with a gun and demanding his money back after realizing the operation was a scam. As he navigates through the building  he is found by John and Amanda and is then chained up to a chair and made to watch the tests unfold. Gabriela is suspended in the air from shackles around her wrist and her ankle and put before an X-ray machine that will burn her flesh. To free herself  Gabriela must use a sledgehammer to break her wrist and ankle. She does so  and falls to the ground  heavily injured but still alive. John orders Amanda to take Gabriela to the hospital  but before she can  Parker holds the two of them at gunpoint and demands them to free Cecilia. As they unchain Cecilia  she shares a kiss with Parker before revealing that he was in on the scam from the beginning and that he was the one she had called on her phone  killing Gabriela by snapping her neck  which leaves Amanda distraught. Cecilia and Parker force John into one of his own traps at gunpoint  chaining him up in the same place Cecilia was in. Before she can do the same with Amanda  she hears Carlos playing with a soccer ball outside the facility again and takes him inside  chaining him up opposite John and wanting John to witness someone completely innocent meet their death in one of his traps  all while John pleads with them to stop what they\'re doing. The trap activates itself  revealing itself to be a seesaw-like contraption that begins to waterboard the two of them with blood. The two of them can pull levers to tilt the seesaw in their direction and thus bear the full brunt of the blasts  and John forces himself to endure non-stop blood-boarding in order to ensure Carlos\' safety. Parker and Cecilia run to the room in which Amanda and John were controlling the games earlier in order to run away with the bags of money they\'d acquired from the scam  however  upon taking the bag of money  it actives a tripwire that stops the blood-boarding trap. As Amanda frees Carlos and John  John watches from below as Parker and Cecilia find themselves trapped inside the control room in a test of their own  which is now filling up with a toxic gas. Their only respite is a hole in the wall that will only fit one of their heads  with Cecilia stabbing Parker to death in order to fit her head through the hole and escape the effects of the gas. The timer runs out and the gas stops coming out  but Cecilia is left trapped in the room as John  Carlos and Amanda exit the building  the movie ending as they walk out into the sunset together.In a mid-credits scene  John and another apprentice of his  Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)  are overseeing Henry in a disused industrial bathroom (as seen in  Saw )  placing him in a trap intended to disembowel him.' , 'Witness the return of Jigsaw.'

Though initially reluctant  Mike accepts the offer after social services threaten to take custody of his younger sister Abby  and pass her over to his estranged aunt Jane  due to concerns of Mike\'s emotional stress.On the first night  Mike falls asleep and has a dream where he witnesses the kidnapping and presumed murder of his brother Garrett  whom was taken away by an unknown man. Mike is then met by five unknown children whom allegedly witnessed the kidnapping  and promptly run away. On the second night  Mike meets police officer Vanessa Shelly  who shows him around the restaurant and tells him that the place closed in the 1980s after five children were murdered there; the bodies were never found. Mike\'s dream is repeated  though after Mike attempts to confront one of the children  he is attacked and wakes up to find himself wounded physically  though his wounds are treated by Vanessa.On the third night  Jane hires a group of delinquents to vandalize the restaurant in order to get Mike fired  an act which would enable her to gain custody of Abby. As the break-in occurs  the restaurant\'s animatronic mascots - Freddy Fazbear  Chica  Foxy and Bonnie - come alive and murder the delinquents. One of the vandals happens to be Abby\'s babysitter Max  which requires Mike to bring Abby to his next shift. The animatronics become active once more  being hostile towards Mike though being friendly towards Abby. The animatronics befriend her  though Vanessa and Mike are hesitant  with the latter discovering that the animatronics are possessed by the ghosts of dead children  whom are led by a boy with blonde hair and allegedly talk about a  yellow rabbit  consistently.In between shifts  Mike explains the disappearance of Garrett when he was young  which became a cold case and that he had been taking sleeping pills every night in order to repeat his dreams and find who kidnapped his brother. After panicking from Abby\'s increasing relationship with the animatronics on the fourth night  Vanessa warns Mike to not bring her to the restaurant again. Mike gets Jane to babysit Abby  much to her frustration  as he goes back to the restaurant during the day and overdoses on his sleeping pills.Inside the dream  the five children appear again and tell Mike that he can stay with Garrett forever  in exchange for Abby. At Mike\'s house  Jane is murdered by  Golden Freddy   a variant of Freddy Fazbear possessed by the blonde boy  who takes Abby back to the restaurant. Mike is attacked several times inside of his dream and wakes up strapped to a torture device that attempts to tear off his face. He escapes the machine and flees the restaurant  but is critically injured until Vanessa arrives to help him.After Mike details his dream  Vanessa reveals that she is the daughter of the serial killer that murdered his brother and the other five children  William Afton  and that the animatronics and souls of the children are under his control. She also tells him that they will likely attempt to murder Abby  much to Mike\'s dismay. He drives to the restaurant with the necessary equipment to disable the animatronics and save Abby  who is taken into a backroom by Chica. Chica tries to kill Abby by stuffing her inside of an animatronic suit with springlocks  though Mike disables most of the animatronics and saves Abby. However  he is attacked by Chica\'s cupcake and is separated from Abby  who is attacked by Foxy but is saved by Vanessa. Both animatronics are defeated  but as the group try to leave the restaurant  William  revealed to have been posing as  Steve Raglan  and having murdered Garrett  appears wearing the now-decaying Spring Bonnie suit  knocks Mike unconscious  and re enables the animatronics.Knowing that they need to understand the truth  Abby begins drawing a picture of William murdering the children  while Vanessa distracts and shoots him but is afterwards stabbed. Abby shows her drawing to the animatronics  causing them to turn on William. Surrounded by the pizzeria\'s main mascots  part of his suit gets bitten off by the cupcake animatronic  triggering the springlock machinery inside of it and crushing his body as he is dragged into the back room of the restaurant and locked away. Mike and Abby carry a wounded Vanessa out of the restaurant  though she falls into a coma afterwards and is taken to a hospital. Mike continues to look after Abby and they return to their normal lives.In a mid-credits scene  Golden Freddy watches as the dying William bleeds out in the corner  closing the door on him soon after.

The conflict renders the planet barren as it loses its air  water  and sunlight.Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton)  the new leader of the Kree  discovers one of the two legendary Quantum Bands. She harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point  a gateway that allows fast travel across space. The resulting anomaly impacts the entire jump point network  including a jump point near Earth\'s S.A.B.E.R. (Strategic Aerospace Bio-Physics and Exo-Linguistic Response) space station that is run by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Nick analyzes the surge in network energy and traces it back to a planet which is close to where Danvers is located currently. Nick asks Danvers to investigate the surge at its source.Captain Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) investigates the jump point near S.A.B.E.R. while Danvers investigates the new jump point that Dar-Benn opened. When they touch their respective jump points  Rambeau is transported to Danvers\' location  Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani)-who has the other Quantum Band on Earth-is transported to Rambeau\'s location  and Danvers is transported to Kamala\'s house.\nMonica is an astronaut for S.A.B.E.R. who has the ability to manipulate all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nKamala is a teenage mutant from Jersey City who idolizes Danvers and wears a Quantum Band (thinking of it as a piece of jewelry)  a magical bangle that unlocked her ability to harness cosmic energy and create hard light constructs.The three use their different light-based powers to fight off Kree enemies at 3 locations where they keep switching places every time one of them uses their powers. The 3 locations are The Khan family home  the space station SABER above Earth and the Skrull refugee colony on planet Tarnax.\nThis battle leave the Khan family home destroyed. Kamala\'s family including mother Muneeba (Zenobia Shroff)  father Yusuf (Mohan Kapur) and brother Aamir (Saagar Shaikh) are forced to join the fight to defend themselves.After the three women return to their original places  Fury and Rambeau visit Kamala on Earth. Rambeau surmises that their light-based powers are linked through quantum entanglement  and that they switch places when any of the three use their powers simultaneously.\nThe three join up at a Skrull refugee colony on the planet Tarnax  which Danvers helped found and where a peace treaty is being negotiated with the Kree. When talks break down  Dar-Benn rips open another jump point which siphons the atmosphere from Tarnax to restore breathable air to Hala.By the time the women figure out the entanglement and how it works  Monica and Kamala end up on Tarnax  while Danvers is on Earth.

Kamala reveals her Band to Danvers and Rambeau. Danvers explains that the Quantum Bands were used to create the jump point transportation network since ancient times. Rambeau says that since Dar-Benn has just one band  she is using the energy from the Kree Universal Weapon to create unstable jump points and overloading the network.Dar-Benn calls Danvers  The Annihilator  and hold her directly responsible for the current state of their home planet Hala. The destruction of the Supreme Intelligence destroyed the planet as well. She promises to restore air  water and sunlight to rejuvenate the planet. Dar-Benn is combining her Quantum Band with the Kree\'s Universal Weapon to jump start the planet Hala\'s sun  but it is not enough.Dar-Benn\'s repeated rupturing of jump points is causing instability to the network and endangering the entire universe.

As the tenth annual Hunger Games approaches  he is one of 24 mentors  each assigned an individual tribute. Due to low viewership  Games author Casca Highbottom advises the mentors to ensure they focus on their tribute entertaining the viewers rather than winning the Games.Coriolanus is assigned the District 12 female tribute  Lucy Gray Baird. Lucy Gray sparks the attention of the Capitol after singing during the reaping  as well as slipping a snake into the clothing of the mayor's daughter Mayfair. Coriolanus is determined to ensure Lucy Gray wins over the hearts of the viewers  as the mentor of the best performing tribute will be promised fortune. Coriolanus attempts to befriend Lucy Gray to earn her trust  riding in the same car as the tributes  where he is accidentally dumped into the Capitol Zoo with the tributes  and humanizing her for the cameras  winning the sympathy of the Capitol citizens.Coriolanus presents a proposal to Head Gamemaker Volumnia Gaul involving a sponsorship scheme  allowing Capitol viewers to donate to tribute's mentors  who can send out supplies during the Games. Coriolanus bonds with Lucy Gray  while another mentor  Arachne  is killed by her tribute after she taunts her. During a tour of the arena with others  a rebel bomb explodes  killing several mentors and tributes. Lucy Gray saves Coriolanus from collapsing debris  changing his perception of her; he gifts her some rat poison hidden in his mother's compact to make use of during the Games.During the Games  many tributes quickly die in the initial chaos. Gaul implements Coriolanus' suggestions to the games and Capitol viewership increases. Lucy Gray survives the initial onslaught by escaping through a hole torn from the rebel explosion  hiding in a service tunnel with District 12's male tribute Jessup. Coriolanus' friend Sejanus Plinth  resentful of the cruelty of the Games  sneaks into the arena and mourns alongside his fallen tribute  who was his former classmate in District Two. Coriolanus enters the arena to extract Sejanus  but they are attacked by tributes; Coriolanus is forced to kill one. The footage of the Games is altered to hide their presence.Soon after  Coriolanus realizes Gaul is going to release a tank of genetically modified snakes into the arena to speed up the Games; the snakes do not attack those with scents they are familiar. Coriolanus secretly puts his father's handkerchief that has Lucy Gray's scent into the tank. When the snakes are released into the arena  they kill all remaining tributes except for Lucy Gray; Gaul initially refuses to declare her the victor  until persuaded to do so by Capitol viewers. After the celebration  Coriolanus is confronted by Highbottom  who shows him the handkerchief and poison. As punishment for cheating  Coriolanus is forced to join the Peacekeepers on a twenty year sentence  and insists on transferring to District 12  though unaware of Lucy Gray's fate.In District 12  Coriolanus starts his Peacekeeper training.

Coriolanus returns to the Capitol and is offered a spot at the University courtesy of Sejanus' parents  who are unaware of his role in their son's death. Coriolanus visits Highbottom  who confesses the Games were never intended to be a reality  and were merely a drunken idea that Crassus  who was his classmate and best friend in university  stole the idea from him and made it into reality. Highbottom never forgave Crassus for this  and sees his deceitful nature in Coriolanus. Coriolanus slips rat poison into Highbottom's drug stash.

Having studied magic and sorcery  Magnifico gained the ability to grant the wishes of his subjects. When each resident turns 18  a ceremony is held where they give up their wish to Magnifico  who keeps them sealed in his observatory. Once a month  Magnifico selects one of the residents' wishes to be granted before the city.\nIn the present day  17-year-old Asha prepares to interview for the role of Magnifico's apprentice  along with her pet goat Valentino. It is her grandfather Sabino's 100th birthday  and Asha hopes Magnifico will grant his wish in commemoration. Her best friend Dahlia  who runs the castle bakery alongside their six friends Simon  Gabo  Bazeema  Safi  Dario  and Hal  advises Asha to be honest about her weaknesses. The interview initially goes well  with Magnifico and Asha expressing a shared desire to protect the wishes of Rosas. However  when Asha requests for Sabino's wish to be granted  Magnifico refuses. A heated argument ensues  and it is revealed that Magnifico erases the memories of the citizens' wishes when they are made  and never returns the ungranted wishes to their owners. In doing so  the populace is rendered docile and free of aspirations  and thus dependent on Magnifico.\nAt the wish-granting ceremony that evening  Magnifico makes a point of not granting Sabino's wish  and dismisses Asha as his apprentice. Asha tries to tell her family the truth about Magnifico  but they do not believe her. Frustrated and out of options  Asha wishes to the heavens  and a ball of light drops from the sky  which is revealed to be a physical manifestation of the star she wished on. Unbeknownst to her  Magnifico observes Star's arrival and interprets it as a threat to Rosas. Against his wife's wishes  Magnifico searches his collection of ancient spell books for a way to counter Star's power.\nMeanwhile  Star's magic brings the forest to life  giving voices to the animals and the plants  as well as Valentino. They explain to Asha that all living things come from stardust. Asha  Valentino and Star embark on a mission to recover Sabino's wish  breaking into Magnifico's study with help from Dahlia.

Agitated  Magnifico turns to dark magic to keep his power over Rosas.\nAsha returns Sabino's wish  and he is overjoyed to have his memories back. However  Magnifico bursts into the family's home  having been informed by a mole that Asha was responsible for Star's arrival. He crushes her mother Sakina's wish as punishment  causing Sakina to be overcome with grief. Star tries to defend her  but is spotted by Magnifico  who vows to capture him. Asha and her family flee with Star; Sabino and Sakina are sent to a neighboring island for safety while Asha returns to the city in pursuit of the other wishes. Magnifico reveals that Simon is the mole who exposed Asha and grants his wish of being a knight  turning him into his pawn.\nMagnifico creates an all-powerful staff by crushing more wishes.

They end up in a storm and take shelter before being found by a heron named Erin (Carol Kane). Although she creeps them out  she offers the Mallards a place to stay for the night along with her husband Harry. After the herons go to sleep  the family tries to sneak out  but Erin catches them and tries to stop them. The Mallards think she is going to eat them until a large fish emerges and tries to swallow Dax and Gwen whole before Erin saves them. Mack and Pam are thankful and stay the rest of the night.The Mallards bid the herons farewell and continue their journey. Dax takes them up to the skies where they play in the clouds before finding themselves in New York City. Uncle Dan gets separated from them and winds up in Central Park. He finds a sandwich and tries to eat it but ends up confronted by a flock of pigeons. The rest of the Mallards arrive  and Mack calls the pigeons  trashy vermin   which offends them all. Their leader  a pigeon with one bad talon named Chump (Awkwafina)  comes to confront Mack  but Pam steps in and negotiates for the pigeons and Uncle Dan to share the sandwich. The family tells Chump their situation  and she says she knows a bird who can get them to Jamaica.Chump guides the Mallards to a restaurant to meet a parrot named Delroy (Keegan-Michael Key)  who was born and raised in Jamaica until a Chef took him from his home and kept him as a trophy pet. This is also when the family learns that ducks like them get cooked and served for dinner. When the Mallards offer to break him out  Delroy says the key to his cage is kept on the Chef\'s person at all times. Mack and Pam sneak into the kitchen. They end up causing a ruckus that enrages the Chef and causes him to chase after them. Mack and Pam end up on the dance floor just as the patrons start to gather for salsa night. They end up dancing their way out of the commotion before making it back to the room. Mack accidentally swallows the key before he can free Delroy  and the Chef catches up to them. In the chaos  Mack regurgitates the key  and Delroy frees himself before the other birds follow.The Mallards say goodbye to Chump and follow Delroy on his way back to Jamaica. Gwen then complains that she needs to poop  but she\'s too embarrassed to do it in the sky. This makes the family stop to land  and they end up finding what appears to be a duck sanctuary  along with a yoga instructor called GooGoo (David Mitchell). The Mallards then have fun like at a water park  but Dax then finds moments later that the Chef is arriving to collect the other ducks there  since it is actually a duck farm. Dax is spotted  and his wings get damaged by the Chef. He runs to warn everyone else  and all the ducks (and Delroy) manage to fly away.The ducks hide at night  but the Chef locates them using his helicopter. He catches all the birds except for Dax and Gwen with his net  and Dax\'s wings are in no shape to fly. The two watch as their parents get taken away  but Dax then gets an idea using Delroy\'s molted feathers.Onboard the helicopter  Pam laments their situation and says that Mack was right about staying at the pond  but he encourages her not to give up. Since Chef locked them in the same cage  they work together to walk out and try to free Uncle Dan  Delroy  and all the other ducks  but Chef catches them again. The other birds retaliate and pelt Chef with produce until he accidentally hits the bottom hatch  causing him and Mack and Pam to fall. Chef gets caught in the net  but Mack and Pam continue to fall until Dax and Gwen arrive  with Dax using Delroy\'s feathers to help him fly. They free their parents and hug while Uncle Dan and Delroy free themselves and all the other ducks.The flock makes their way to Jamaica  as they find the water glowing and end up on the island. Dax reunites with Kim  while Mack thanks Pam for helping him get the family out for once. The birds then have a dance party.When the spring comes  the Mallards find that a flock of penguins has shown up and needs help getting back to the South Pole. They then set off on yet another family trip.' , 'Soar into a new adventure.'  'Odd ducks welcome.'  'Arriving this Christmas.'  'Adventure takes flight.'  'Arriving in cinemas February 2.

The submarine is under Bering strait  and the Russian Navy is testing the AI system to help evade enemy submarines. So far  the system has performed miraculously  and the submarine has deliberately approached every navy in the world and remained undetected. The AI system is enclosed within a fortified done housed within the submarine.\nThe AI deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target only to be struck by their own torpedo  killing all aboard. The flooded submarine  along with the fortified dome housing the AI system sits at the bottom of the Bering strait. The bodies of the 2 officers with the 2 parts of the key  floats to the surface.Ethan Hunt is assigned the task to retrieve the key  one half of which is with Isla Faust.\nIMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and successfully retrieves a key piece from disavowed MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). He also fakes her death to ensure she survives a bounty of $50 million placed by an unknown source.Back in Washington  D.C.  he infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger (Cary Elwes) discussing the AI  known as the  Entity  (Simon Pegg).\nCIA director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) states the Entity achieved sentience and can manipulate cyberspace  allowing it to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. It has infiltrated all major defense systems globally and has not done anything. It sent a very clear message that it can return anytime and assume control. The CIA does not know the goal of the Entity. The Entity now resides in the cloud.\nNow it is infiltrating all intelligence networks around the world and corrupting their data. Governments are taking physical backups of their files before they are lost to the Entity. The Entity would know every weakness of every country  network  system out there. The servers have been isolated from the outside world  but the Entity has managed to bribe and blackmail humans to infiltrate the servers and continue towards its goal.World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key to control the Entity  though the exact means of controlling it are unknown. Kittridge says that a buyer is passing through the Middle East in the next 72 hours and already has one half of the key.\nKittridge tells Denlinger that the other half of the Key was with Ilsa  and he had sent his agent to retrieve the key from her.Revealing himself  Ethan converses with Kittridge and deduces that Kittridge placed Ilsa\'s bounty. Ethen refuses to give the half key to Kittridge and states his intention to destroy the Entity  knowing they would be considered rogue actors and are participating in a global race.\nEthan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the buyer of the other key piece while evading US agents led by Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham). Ethan\'s plan was to sell their half of the key to the buyer  and then follow the buyer to figure out what it unlocks.\nEthan locates the buyer at Abu Dhabi airport and follows him to his flight to Venice.During the pursuit  the key piece is stolen by a professional thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell). Ethan confronts Grace and offers to put the key back in the buyer\'s pocket in exchange for a generous payment of $4 million. But the buyer was already dead and the key that Grace stole was a counterfeit. Which means that someone had manipulated Ethan to be at the airport with the real key.\nConcurrently  Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device  which was headed to the same flight as the buyer and Ethan. While Ethan was distracted  Grace steals the real key from Ethan.\nEthan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel (Esai Morales)  a sadistic Entity liaison with ties to his Pre-IMF past. Gabriel is a powerful terrorist and Ethan\'s adversary who appears to be working with the Entity. He and Ethan had a fateful encounter with each other prior to Ethan becoming an IMF agent.Aborting the mission  the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. She is apprehended upon arrival but Ethan rescues her from local authorities  US agents  and an Entity operative named Paris (Pom Klementieff). Paris pursues Ethan and Grace and kills many US agents and Roman police along the way  but they still manage to escape by working together. Grace had revealed to Ethan that she was delivering the key to a party in Venice.\nGrace escapes again  while Ethan rendezvous with Luther  Benji  with Ilsa rejoining them. With Benji and Luther providing support  Ethan and Ilsa follow Grace to Venice where they infiltrate a party held by the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby)  also known as the White Widow.\nLuther had figured out by analyzing the video feed from the airport that Gabriel is working for the Entity and was most probably the person who planted the bomb. Ilsa says that Gabriel is the Entity\'s messenger and that the key leads to the Entity\'s source code. But it was Ilsa\'s friends at MI6 who shared this information with her digitally.\nEthan suspects that the Entity is manipulating their actions and there is a reason why it has assembled all his dear friends in Venice. But the 4 agree that they cannot let Gabriel have the complete key.All groups  Alanna  Gabriel  Ethan  Grace  Ilsa gather at the party. Ethan realizes that the party was organized by the Entity as well. All groups disclose their role in acquiring the complete key. Grace was hired by Alanna to steal the other key piece to produce the completed key  which will be sold to her buyer the next day on the Orient Express. Ethan knows that Alanna doesn\'t want to keep the key for herself as she does not know what it unlocks. Alanna cannot decide whether to give the key to her friend Ethan  or to Gabriel and put her fate in his hands.Through the Entity  Gabriel proclaims he will possess the completed key the next day and that either Ilsa or Grace will die. Ethan unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Alanna from the sale  allowing Gabriel and Grace to escape. Ethan pursues Grace (as she still has one half of the key)  but the Entity hacks into their communications and impersonates Benji  leading him away from Grace and into a fight with Paris  whom he spares.Concurrently  The Entity leads Grace and Isla to Gabriel. Gabriel incapacitates Grace and kills Ilsa  devastating Grace and Ethan  who vows vengeance. Thus  Grace agrees to impersonate Alanna and take the key during the sale. Luther leaves for an off-grid location to prevent interference from the Entity  advising Ethan to spare Gabriel to determine information about the Entity. Luther says that the Entity knows that Ethan is the only one who wants to kill the Entity  which is why it used Gabriel to kill Ilsa  so Ethan would be provoked to kill Gabriel and with him all knowledge about what the key unlocks.The next day  on the train  Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. Grace infiltrates the train impersonating Alanna and gets her half of the key.\nWith Paris  Gabriel meets Denlinger  who divulges information only he knows in an attempt to form an alliance between himself and the Entity.Originally an advanced cyber weapon developed by the US  the Entity went rogue following its deployment against the Sevastopol (The US deployed an early copy of the on the submarine to sabotage her stealth capability). Meanwhile  outside  the AI evolved and rewrote itself  becoming the Entity. So  inside the submarine is the only remaining copy of the AI\'s original source code which can be used to control or destroy it.\nThe completed key unlocks a chamber inside the vessel containing the Entity\'s source code  allowing it to be destroyed or controlled. Gabriel subsequently kills Denlinger and tries to kill Paris as the Entity determined she would betray them after Ethan spared her life.\nImpersonating Alanna  Grace brings the key to Kittridge  revealed to be the buyer  and negotiates a $100 million sale alongside protection for herself  but pickpockets the key from Kittridge after canceling the transfer. Ethan parachutes into the train to save Grace  but Gabriel acquires the key.Ethan and Gabriel fight atop the train  but Gabriel escapes and detonates a bridge ahead. Grace and Ethan detach the locomotive from the rest of the train  saving the passengers. Paris rescues both from falling and manages to tell Ethan the key\'s connection to the Sevastopol before losing consciousness. Grace informs Kittridge of her desire to join the IMF.Ethan flees the wreckage by para-glider with the completed key  which he took from Gabriel during the fight  and rendezvous with Benji to continue the mission  which is finding the Sevastopol and destroying the Entity.' , 'Our lives are the sum of our choices.

Lead mechanic Tachibana implies that Shikishima fled from his duty. That night  a dinosaur-like creature  Godzilla  attacks. Shikishima gets in his plane but cannot bring himself to shoot the monster and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up to learn that Tachibana is the only other survivor  who blames Shikishima for failing to act.In 1946  Shikishima returns home to find his parents were killed in the bombing of Tokyo. Plagued by survivor\'s guilt  he works as a minesweeper and begins supporting a woman  Noriko Oishi  whose parents also died in the bombing  and an orphaned baby  Akiko  whom Noriko rescued.Later that year  Godzilla is mutated and enlarged by the United States\' nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll; it destroys several U.S. warships before heading for Japan. The U.S. refuses help  owing to tensions with the Soviet Union  but General Douglas MacArthur sends decommissioned Imperial Japanese Navy vessels.In May 1947  Shikishima and his minesweeper crew are tasked with stopping Godzilla\'s approach to Japan  in reality stalling for time for larger vessels to arrive. They release a mine into Godzilla\'s mouth and detonate it  doing significant damage  but it quickly regenerates. The heavy cruiser Takao then arrives and engages Godzilla  but is subsequently destroyed when Godzilla unleashes its atomic  heat ray. After returning to Tokyo  Shikishima tells Noriko about the attack and his earlier encounter with Godzilla. Days later  Godzilla makes landfall in Japan  attacking Ginza  where Noriko works. Noriko narrowly avoids dying and is found by Shikishima. Type 4 Chi-To medium tanks engage Godzilla  but it fires its heat ray which causes a nuclear explosion that obliterates Ginza  killing tens of thousands. Noriko pushes Shikishima into an alley but is caught in the blast herself and presumed dead. Devastated by the loss of Noriko  Shikishima vows revenge against Godzilla.Godzilla departs  but is expected to return; the government refuses to do more to prevent another attack. One of the minesweeper\'s crew  former Naval engineer Kenji Noda plans to destroy Godzilla by surrounding it with Freon tanks and rupturing them  lowering the water\'s buoyancy and sinking it to a depth of 1 500 meters  letting the resultant pressure crush it. Should that plan fail  balloons will be inflated under Godzilla to force it back up to the surface  killing it through explosive decompression. He has recruited private citizens  mostly former Naval members  to enact his plan. Shikishima recruits Tachibana  the mechanic he fought alongside  to repair a broken-down Kyushu J7W Shinden fighter. Shikishima plans to fly into Godzilla\'s mouth  then detonate an explosive charge inside the plane in an attempt to destroy the monster from the inside. He leaves Akiko in the care of his neighbour Sumiko.Godzilla resurfaces  and Shikishima draws it into the trap. After Godzilla is tricked into destroying two unmanned destroyers with its heat ray  the two remaining ships get close and wrap it in the buoys. Godzilla is then successfully dragged down to 1 500 meters but survives. The balloons are activated  forcing Godzilla up to 800 meters  but it survives and manages to break free. Two ships try to haul Godzilla to the surface but fail. A fleet of tugboats lend their assistance and Godzilla is brought to the surface. Still alive and enraged  Godzilla prepares to destroy all the ships with its heat ray. Shikishima flies the explosive plane into Godzilla\'s mouth and remembers Tachibana imploring him to use the ejection seat  to let go of his survivor\'s guilt and choose to live. The plane explodes  destroying Godzilla\'s head and causing the energy of its heat ray to tear its body apart. The crew celebrates as Shikishima parachutes down  having chosen to live.Shikishima receives a telegram and heads to the hospital with Akiko.

Ahmed smelled the ambush when the Afghan solider led them on a particular road  and Ahmed got Kinley to stop the convoy. Satellite pictures reveal a ambush lined up 8 Kilometers down the road.\nKinley\'s team includes Charlie  Jizzy  Crow (Sean Sagar)  Joshua  JJ  Jung (Jason Wong)  Tom \'Tom Cat\' Hancock (Rhys Yates)  Eduardo  Chow Chow  Lopez (Christian Ochoa)  Steve Kersher (Bobby Schofield) and Jack  Jack Jack  Jackson (James Nelson-Joyce).\nAhmed is shown to be married to Basira (Fariba Sheikhan) with a kid on the way.During another raid to check for a possible insurgent arms cache about 120 kilometers (74 miles) north of Bagram Air Base  Kinley\'s unit is attacked by Taliban reinforcements  who kill everyone except for him and Ahmed. Kinley\'s unit has requested air support when they discovered arms  but air cover was 15 minutes out when they were attacked. The duo manages to escape on a Taliban truck  killing several Taliban fighters in the process.\nThe truck gets a flat  and Kinley cannot contact his base as the radio is out of range. Kinley and Ahmed are forced to abandon the truck and escape on foot  killing their pursuers in the process.\nThe helicopters from base reach the original location and find 40 Taliban bodies and the bodies of the dead US soldiers minus Ahmed and Kinley.Whilst attempting to return to the airbase by navigating through the mountainous Afghan terrain  they are once again ambushed by insurgents  who manage to wound Kinley  before clubbing him with a rifle butt  incapacitating him. Ahmed manages to kill the Taliban and resolves to take Kinley back to the air base.\nReceiving help from some sympathetic Afghans  Ahmed evades the Taliban hunting them  carrying Kinley over the country\'s treacherous mountain topography. Several days later Ahmed and Kinley are near Bagram but are attacked by Taliban fighters; Ahmed kills the fighters but is shortly thereafter apprehended by U.S. troops.Three weeks later  Kinley  having been repatriated to his home in Santa Clarita  California  is completely unaware of how he was saved  but understands Ahmed\'s role in it. Kinley married to his wife Caroline (Emily Beecham) and has 2 kids.\nUpon learning that Ahmed and his family were forced to move underground owing to the duo\'s escapade having become local folklore (The Taliban have put a heavy price on Ahmed\'s head and is on their top 10 most wanted list)  Kinley attempts to procure U.S. visas for them for over a month  but in vain.\nEmotionally tormented and rendered near sleepless by his inability to repay his indebtedness towards Ahmed  Kinley finally resolves to save him himself  enlisting the assistance of his superior  Lieutenant Colonel Vokes (Jonny Lee Miller)  to procure the visas.Returning to Afghanistan under the alias of Ron Kay  Kinley meets with Parker (Antony Starr)  a private military contractor  who promises to provide support on the condition that the former locates Ahmed first. But Kinley has to find Ahmed alone.\nMeanwhile Ahmed is being actively hunted by the Taliban  and he has to move frequently with his family to survive.Kinley meets Ahmed\'s brother Ali  a Taliban supplier who manages to smuggle Kinley across their territory; in the process  he kills two insurgents after nearly being caught at a road checkpoint  which alerts the Taliban with the sound of gunfire that echoes through the mountains.\nVokes informs Kinley that the visas have been processed and are with Parker. Finally arriving at Ahmed\'s hideout  Kinley persuades him and his family to accompany him to the U.S. Meanwhile  Parker deduces Kinley\'s true identity; realizing the danger that the duo is in due to their value to the Taliban  he arranges for an AC-130 gunship and an Apache attack helicopter to provide air support. Concurrently  the Taliban mount an attack on Kinley  who manages to escape with Ahmed\'s family to the nearby Darunta Dam which is the extraction point designated by Parker.Cornered by approaching Taliban units  the duo engages them in a protracted gunfight  which ends when they run out of ammunition. However  the AC-130 and Apache helicopter arrive and wipe out the attackers. Parker arrives from the other end of the dam with a relief column of anti-Taliban technical personnel. He tells Kinley he would have supported his mission gratis had he known upfront it was him. Escorted back to Bagram  the group boards an Airbus A400M leaving Afghanistan.The film\'s ending title states that in the aftermath of the Taliban\'s recapture of Afghanistan  over 300 Afghan interpreters affiliated with the U.S. military were murdered by the organization  with thousands more still in hiding.' ,nan

For instance  krakens aren\'t monstrous ship-destroyers  but mighty warriors.In the town of Oceanside  Ruby Gillman (Lana Condor) is a young kraken living on the surface world with her parents Agatha (Toni Collette) and Arthur (Colman Domingo)  plus little brother Sam (Blue Chapman) and pet squid Nessie. Agatha is a real estate agent while Arthur runs an ASMR channel for people who like making ships in a bottle. Ruby\'s best friends are Margot (Liza Koshy)  Bliss (Ramona Young)  and Trevin (Eduardo Franco). They are all set to go to prom  which will be held on a boat  but because Agatha forbids Ruby from going near the water  she and her friends have missed out on many events.Ruby fails to convince Agatha to let her go to prom but still decides to take a chance to ask out her crush  Connor (Jaboukie Young-White)  whom she is tutoring in math. Ruby\'s friends give her a confetti cannon to use as a promposal for Connor  but before she can use it  he says people should simply ask one another. He then sees the confetti cannon and takes it from Ruby  only to blast himself in the face with confetti that makes him slip on his skateboard over a railing and into the water. Ruby hesitantly attempts to jump in and save Connor  and when she jumps into the water  she begins glowing purple  and a pulse goes across the ocean. After some struggle  Ruby manages to pull Connor to the surface.A crowd of onlookers surround Connor as they believe someone else saved him. The new girl in town  Chelsea Van Der Zee (Annie Murphy)  starts to take credit for saving Connor. Just as Ruby tries to talk to him  her left hand starts glowing. Ruby runs to the library to try to call her mom  but she grows to a colossal size and destroys the library before running to hide.From a distance  Agatha sees her daughter\'s gigantic form and rushes to help her. She runs into her brother Brill (Sam Richardson)  who was sent by their mom (who happens to be the Queen) to find Ruby since they felt the pulse underwater. Agatha and Brill find Ruby hiding behind a lighthouse. Agatha explains to Ruby that this is normal for them and that she shouldn\'t feel like a monster. Ruby shrinks back to her normal size before going back home  where Agatha tells Arthur what happened. Before Brill leaves  Ruby overhears him arguing with Agatha over keeping this a secret from Ruby.Ruby follows Brill to the water  where he spills the beans on her grandmother.

She explains to Ruby the history of the krakens and how the mermaids are their archenemies due to a war from long ago. The mermaid Queen Narissa attempted to rule the ocean using the Trident of Oceanus  but Agatha fought back and banished the mermaids. However  instead of succeeding Grandmamah for the throne  Agatha chose to live on the surface world. When Grandmamah presents Ruby to the rest of the krakens as her successor  she panics and flees.As Ruby leaves  she falls into a trap laid out by crusty sailor Gordon Lighthouse (Will Forte)  who is obsessed with catching a kraken after Ruby was spotted by onlookers earlier.

While Chelsea tries to befriend Ruby  she ends up fleeing back home.At school  everybody is talking about the kraken sighting. Ruby finds Chelsea and tries to get help with blending in with others. They go back underwater together where Chelsea shows Ruby a series of currents where the Trident is being kept. Chelsea says she wants to help the mermaids  suggesting she is Narissa\'s daughter and that she wants to make things right. She convinces Ruby that they can end the war between krakens and mermaids if they get the Trident back. Ruby tries to swim through the currents but keeps getting thrown back. She goes back to Grandmamah to learn how to utilize her abilities  such as swimming better and using laser eyes.While Ruby and Chelsea start to hang out more  Ruby begins neglecting her friends. Meanwhile  Gordon goes on the hunt for the kraken and asks for volunteers  so Arthur  Brill  and Sam join him and use Nessie to trick him into thinking he\'s caught a kraken baby.During an open house party that Agatha is throwing  Ruby tries to convince her that she and Chelsea are friends and that they can end the kraken/mermaid feud  but Agatha says Chelsea is dangerous. Ruby gets angered and grows huge again  destroying the house before going back to the ocean. Agatha follows and goes back to her mother  saying that Narissa\'s daughter is manipulating Ruby  until Grandmamah says Narissa never had a daughter. They realize Ruby is in trouble.Ruby manages to swim through the currents and retrieve the Trident.

So  they started migrating workers from India in large numbers to work their fields and factories. Many youths from Punjab took this opportunity to make a life for themselves in England. Soon  this spurred other youth to find ways to migrate to the UK. The Commonwealth Immigration Act of 1962 put an end to migration. It was now difficult to move to England  but the dream persisted.An elderly Manu Randhawa (Taapsee Pannu) runs away from a hospital in London and meets immigration lawyer Puru Patel (Deven Bhojani). Manu wants a visa to India  but Puru says that getting her an Indian visa is difficult due to her past actions. Manu knows that only Hardy can get her back to India.\nShe requests his assistance in connecting her with her ex-lover Hardayal  Hardy  Singh Dhillon (Shah Rukh Khan). In Laltu  Punjab  an aged Hardy is ecstatic to receive Manu\'s call after 25 years. She asks him to meet her in Dubai so that he can bring her back to India through the Dunki route because she is unable to get an Indian visa. Manu  and her friends Buggu and Balli board a flight to get to Dubai.25 years ago  in 1995  Manu and her friends Balindar  Buggu  Lakhanpal (Vikram Kochhar) and Balli (Anil Grover)  live in Laltu and yearn to immigrate to London for a better life. Manu\'s house was mortgaged  and she worked as a cook at a Dhaba  Buggu\'s mother had to work as a guard at a local factory and Balli\'s mother used to sew clothes to make ends meet  so he worked a barber.\nPoor and uneducated  they are unable to procure a visa despite trying various methods.\nThe agent tells Manu to learn wrestling  so he can get her a sports visa on the Indian Wrestling team for the Olympics.One day  Hardy  an ex-army officer  arrives in their village. Manu\'s brother Mahinder (Suhail Zargar) had saved his life when he was shot by terrorists. Mahinder was a civilian  but carried Hardy on his shoulders to the nearest military hospital and even stayed with him for many weeks till he was out of danger.\nHardy had come to return his personal belongings  but realizes that Mahinder has died in an accident  leaving Manu and her family in a poor financial situation. Mahinder was survived by a widow (Jaanvi Sangwan) and her son.Hardy promises to help Manu reach London in return for her brother\'s kindness. Hardy starts to teach wrestling moves to Manu. When Manu returns to the agent  she finds that he was a fake and he ran away after taking money from Balli (Rs 30 000) and Buggu (Rs 150 000). Buggu was asked to pose as a doctor  with fake degrees  but he fails the simple questions from the immigration officer. Balli was asked to marry a UK citizen who was supposedly in India but turns out many other men had paid their agents to marry the same woman  who never existed.When they are told by Hardy that by passing the IELTS test  it is easier to get a UK student visa  they enroll at an IELTS coaching class taught by Geetu Gulati (Boman Irani)  where they meet Sukhi (Vicky Kaushal). Sukhi wants to travel to London to save his ex-girlfriend  Jassi  who was married off to an NRI man who physically abuses her.\nWhen Geetu makes fun of Hardy in class  Manu stands up for him and defends him. She says that a good teacher is like Hardy who hand holds the students and makes them practice  instead of laughing at them. Hardy falls in love with Manu.\nSince Geetu is not an effective teacher  Hardy comes up with a generic speech which can be given against any topic in the speaking test and makes everyone memorize it. But the IELTS test goes differently for everyone  with only Balli get the opportunity to use the generic speech.\nBalli eventually clears the exams and the rest fail.Once in London  Balli sends photos of himself in front of a big house and a car  making his friends and family in India believe that he has made it big in the UK. He also tells Sukhi that Jassi has died by suicide after learning about Sukhi failing in IELTS  due to which Sukhi immolates himself.Traumatized by Sukhi\'s death  Hardy promises to take Manu and Buggu to London himself through the Dunki route.

They find jobs as cleaning staff in malls and large grocery stores  or as selling adult films.They meet lawyer Puru Patel  who advises Manu to enter into a sham marriage as an easy way to get UK citizenship. Manu reluctantly agrees to go and marry a drug addict for 1000 pounds. Puru says that once Manu is a citizen  she can divorce the addict and then help make Buggu and Balli citizens too.\nDuring the wedding ceremony in church  Hardy is enraged by the drug addict\'s attempt to kiss Manu  and they engage in a fight due to which they are both arrested  along with Balli and Buggu.\nIn court  Puru advises them to seek right of asylum to stay in the country by claiming that their lives are under threat in India. As an ex-army officer  Hardy refuses to betray his country  but the rest agree as a means to get asylum and settle in England. Hardy makes a passionate plea that asylum due to poverty or prosecution makes no difference  but the judge follows the law and ignores that human tragedy behind the curse of poverty.\nHardy is soon deported to India  while the rest become British citizens  initially working as living statues.In the present day  Manu tells Hardy that she wants to go back home as she is dying of a brain tumor. Her visa was denied by India as she  Balli and Buggu had claimed asylum in India. Manu also reveals that she never married and only published a card for Hardy  so that he moved on and got settled back in India.\nThey try to leave for India via cargo container in Jeddah. But the agent tells the Saudi immigration authorities about 4 Indians going to London in a container. This was a ruse. The 4 are arrested.\nThey eventually fool immigration officials into believing that they are Indian citizens traveling illegally to London. They give their names as Gulaab  Pumpi and Chameli who are still listed as Indian citizens and India accepts them back. The Saudi immigration authorities prove in court that the 4 are Indians and put them on a flight back to India.\nOnce they reach Laltu  Manu is shocked to learn that Hardy never married out of love for her. Moments after Hardy proposes to her  Manu dies from her ailment. Heartbroken  Hardy puts the engagement ring into her hands and hugs her  watching the Diwali fireworks in the evening.The film ends with an epilogue that no visas were issued to travel to other countries about 140 years ago.' ,nan

Jabba again refuses and drops Luke through a trap door into a pit below his throne that houses the rancor  a fearsome beast that Jabba keeps for executions. As Leia watches in horror  she sees Lando Calrissian disguised as a palace guard. After a brief battle  Luke defeats the rancor  enraging Jabba  who declares that Luke  Solo and Chewbacca will be slowly consumed by the sarlacc -- a huge  shark-toothed  tentacled maw at the bottom of the Great Pit of Carkoon.The group is taken to the pit on Jabba\'s sail barge fleet  and Jabba sadistically attempts to draw out the spectacle by inviting them to grovel for their lives. Han and Chewbacca refuse  but Luke calmly notes to the gangster that he is about to pay dearly for his arrogance to Jabba\'s scoffing amusement. The group is prepared for execution: Luke is the first  pushed out onto a thin plank over the pit. Luke gives R2 a short salute and drops off the plank  only to spin and grab the plank to launch himself back on board. At that moment  R2 catapults a small object  Luke\'s new lightsaber  to the Jedi\'s hand. A battle erupts  with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba\'s men. During the battle  Leia strangles Jabba with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2\'s help escapes from her bonds. Solo accidentally knocks Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) into the sarlacc pit. Lando is also thrown off one of the skiffs  hanging by a few cables until he\'s rescued from the sarlacc itself by Han and Chewbacca. Luke  having fought his way onto Jabba\'s sail barge  has the escaping Leia aim the deck cannon at the vehicle and sets it on automatic fire; the sail barge soon blows apart. Our heroes manage to escape before it explodes  retrieve R2 and C-3PO and zip off into the desert. Luke flies off Tatooine in his X-Wing fighter and the rest of the band fly away in the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near Sullust.A massive fleet of fighters completely surrounds the boarding bays of the Death Star at the arrival of the Emperor. As Red Guards slowly descend from the Imperial shuttle and flank its ramp  Vader and the Death Star commander kneel to their master  the last to enter the hangar. He insists that Lord Vader will soon capture Luke Skywalker  and Luke will learn of the dark side of the Force when brought before Palpatine himself.Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training  but he finds Yoda (voice: Frank Oz) is ill. He tells Luke that no further training is required and all that remains to be done is to confront Darth Vader. Luke attempts to get independent confirmation of Darth Vader\'s claim to be Luke\'s father  but Yoda is evasive. Finally  Luke begs Yoda to tell him the truth  and Yoda  emotional torture clearly evident on his normally serene features  confirms Luke\'s darkest fears. He correctly infers that Vader has used this information as an emotional weapon against Luke  and criticizes Luke for having faced Vader prematurely  with nearly disastrous consequences. He reminds Luke of the true nature of the Force  and of the soul-corrupting nature of the dark side. Yoda then issues a dark warning  telling Luke how his father fell to the shadow: he was corrupted by the powers and influence of the Emperor. If Luke allows himself to be manipulated by this dark mind  then he too shall become what he most fears.Finally  Yoda charges Luke with keeping alive the teachings and knowledge of the Jedi and the Force  urging him to start with his own family  with whom the Force is unusually strong. With his final breath  Yoda tells Luke that there is  another Skywalker.  Yoda dies at peace  and before Luke\'s astonished eyes  his body vanishes  passing with his spirit into the Force. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) confronts a distraught Luke  confirming that Vader was once Anakin Skywalker  a Jedi who was turned to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan confesses to Luke that he made mistakes in Anakin\'s training  especially by not deferring to Yoda  and takes responsibility for indirectly creating the evil Darth Vader. Luke counters that even now  all is not lost  that some part of Anakin remains  if only someone can reach it. When Luke asks about the other Skywalker  Obi-Wan tells him that Luke has a twin sister  hidden from Anakin and separated from Luke at birth to protect them both from the Emperor. Luke intuits that his sister is Princess Leia. Obi-Wan confirms it  but warns Luke that in the eyes of the Empire  all bonds of love and caring are potential weaknesses to be exploited.Meanwhile  the entire Rebel Alliance fleet is massing their near Sullust  meeting to devise an attack strategy on the uncompleted Death Star. As part of the attack  Han and his companions must land on the forest moon of Endor and deactivate the generator that projects a protective shield up to the orbiting Death Star. The team  led by Han  will use a stolen Imperial shuttle and confirmation code to infiltrate the heavy security measures protecting the construction site before the rest of the Rebel fleet arrives. Luke arrives at the meeting and tells Han and Leia that he\'ll join them on the dangerous commando mission. The fleet\'s assault on the Death Star will be lead by Lando Calrissian  piloting the Millennium Falcon  which will fly into the core of the space station and destroy the main power generator.The team arrives at Endor in the stolen shuttle and uses the confirmation code to sneak past the Imperial fleet. Luke senses that Vader is aboard the Imperial fleet\'s largest ship  the super-star destroyer Executor  and believes he\'s endangering the mission. Han tells him not to worry.When they arrive on the moon  the team happens across a small unit of Imperial biker scouts. Han tries to sneak up on the scouts to disarm them but draws their attention when he steps on a branch. Leia and Luke jump on speeder bikes and pursue two more scouts through the forest at high speed. They overtake them both but are separated; Leia\'s bike crashes into a tree after she jumps off and she falls unconscious. Luke jumps off his own bike and battles with the the scout he\'d been pursuing  forcing him to crash using his lightsaber. When Luke rejoins the team  he finds that Leia hasn\'t returned. The team looks for her but is captured by indigenous creatures called Ewoks -- short  furry  intelligent forest dwellers. An Ewok called Wicket (Warwick Davis) befriends Leia  but the other Ewoks who captured the rest of the Rebel party decide to sacrifice them to C-3P0  who they believe is a god. Luke  having mastered the Force  levitates C-3P0 to impress the Ewoks with the droid\'s power and scare them into giving up the sacrifice. With the help of C-3PO  Luke and his party form an alliance with the Ewoks  whose stone-age technology has unexpectedly effective military applications.Later  Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vader. He confesses to Leia that he is her brother  and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. She tells him to ignore his feelings and leave but Luke tells her that he must face his destiny and if necessary in the event that he falls  she must learn the ways of the Jedi to help oppose the Emperor. Luke surrenders peacefully to Vader but fails to convince his father to abandon the dark side even though Vader is left subtly shaken by his matured son\'s own mind games.They go to the Death Star to meet the Emperor  who reveals that the Rebel Alliance is walking into a trap. On the forest moon  the Rebels led by Solo and Leia enter the shield generator control facility only to be taken prisoner by a large legion of Imperial troops. Once they are led out of the bunker  however  the Ewoks spring a surprise counterattack. In a desperate ground battle  the Rebels and Ewoks fight the Imperial forces. Aboard the Death Star  the Emperor attempts to seduce Luke with the powers of the dark side. The Emperor reveals his plan: the information that Rebel spies had stolen was part of an elaborate plan to draw out the Rebel fleet and command so they could be eliminated in one battle. As Luke\'s anger builds he attacks the Emperor with his lightsaber  only to be stopped by Vader\'s crimson blade.During the strike team\'s assault  the Rebel fleet emerges from hyperspace for the battle over Endor  only to discover that the shield of the Death Star is still functioning. An intense space battle takes place as the Imperial fleet  in the second phase of the Emperor\'s plan  appears and attacks the Rebel fleet. During the battle  the Death Star is revealed to be operational; its superlaser  revealed to be relatively rapid-fire on a low setting compared to its predecessor  is fired at the Rebel fleet and obliterates a Rebel star cruiser. Though Admiral Ackbar wants to abandon the attack  Lando convinces him that they must give Han and his party more time on Endor. The fleet regroups and begins to engage the Imperial fleet of star destroyers directly.On the Death Star  the Emperor taunts Luke to give in to his anger. A ferocious lightsaber duel has erupted between Luke and his father. In the midst of combat  Vader reads Luke\'s feelings and learns that Luke has a twin sister. When Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side  Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle  slicing off Vader\'s right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut  and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son\'s blade. Despite the Emperor\'s goading Luke refuses to kill his father  realizing that he is traveling down his father\'s path towards the dark side  and declares himself a Jedi. Realizing that Luke cannot be turned  the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him  Vader repents and turns on the Emperor  throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death. At the same time  however  the Emperor\'s Force lightning causes fatal injuries to Vader (Anakin) and short-circuits his breathing system. Stopping momentarily in a landing bay  Anakin asks Luke to take his mask off  knowing that he\'ll die  but desiring to look at his son\'s face with his human eyes. Luke removes the helmet  revealing the pale and scarred face of his father (Sebastian Shaw). Anakin says that Luke was right about him  and asks Luke to tell his sister. With those final words  Anakin dies.Back on Endor  the strike team finally destroys the shield generator. The Rebel fleet seizes the opportunity to launch a final assault on the Death Star in space. Meanwhile to by the attackers more time  Admiral Ackbar orders a concentrated attack on the Imperial fleet\'s flagship  the Executor. With a crashing rebel pilot ramming into the ship\'s bridge  not only is Admiral Piett killed  but the ship goes out of control and collides with the Death Star. Lando leads Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) and his fighter group into the bowels of the Death Star  where they fire at the main reactor  causing its collapse. Luke  with the body and armor of Anakin  escapes the Death Star in an Imperial shuttle. Moments later  Wedge in his X-Wing and Lando in the Millennium Falcon emerge from the Death Star just as the space station explodes.On Endor  Han tries to reassure Leia that Luke was likely not on the destroyed station  but Leia already senses that is true. Guessing Leia\'s feelings for Luke  Han offers to step aside for him to court her. However  Leia reassures Han Solo of her love and reveals to him that Luke is actually her brother  who obviously will support their own romance to Han\'s astonished relief. That evening  Luke cremates the remains of his father in a funeral pyre on Endor. The entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the Emperor and the Rebel victory over the Empire. Luke  Leia  Han  Lando  and the rest of the rebels  along with the Ewoks  celebrate the victory as well. During the celebration  Luke catches sight of the spirit figures of Obi-Wan Kenobi  Yoda  and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker  who look proudly upon him.' , 'Coming May 25  1983 to your galaxy.

-64.923631,2023,Anatomy of a Fall,70,151,7.8,583,20240322,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,  In an isolated mountain chalet near Grenoble  Samuel Maleski is playing music in his attic so loudly that his wife  German novelist Sandra Voyter  asks to reschedule with the female student interviewing her. Their visually impaired son  Daniel  returns from a long walk with his guide dog Snoop to find Samuel dead below his attic window.Talking to an old friend  lawyer Vincent Renzi  Sandra says the fall must have been accidental. When Vincent says the court will not believe that  Sandra tells Vincent about Samuel's attempt to overdose on aspirin six months earlier  after having gone off antidepressants. Vincent notes a bruise on her arm  which she tells him resulted from bumping into a countertop.Daniel tells the police that his parents were having a calm talk when he left the house but gives conflicting accounts of exactly where he was standing. This  combined with an autopsy revealing Samuel's head wound occurred before his body hit the ground  blood spatter  and an audio recording Samuel made of a fight he and Sandra had the day before he died  prompts an indictment.During the trial  Sandra's defense team claims Samuel fell from the attic window and hit his head on a shed  while the prosecution's theory is that Sandra hit him with a blunt object and pushed him from the third-floor balcony. During a courtroom argument with Samuel's psychiatrist  Sandra admits her resentment towards Samuel due to his partial responsibility for the accident that led to Daniel's impaired vision.In the recorded fight  Samuel accuses Sandra of plagiarism  infidelity  and exerting control over his life. The protracted argument turns physically violent  but it is unclear who is hitting whom. The prosecution claims that all the violence was coming from Sandra. She says that she had thrown a glass at a wall and slapped Samuel's face  that the bruises on her arms were due to Samuel grabbing her  and that the rest of the violence heard was Samuel beating on himself.After Sandra admits to having had an affair with a woman the year before Samuel's death  the prosecution argues that Samuel's loud music indicated jealousy over Sandra's flirting with the interviewer  leading to a physical confrontation where the prosecution claims Sandra killed him. The prosecutor notes her pattern of writing personal conflicts into her stories and how murdering Samuel could mirror a minor character's thoughts from her most recent novel.Sandra protests that one audio recording does not remotely represent the nature of their marriage  nor do the words of a character in one of her novels reflect her own inclinations. Disturbed by what has transpired  Daniel insists on testifying before closing arguments the following Monday  and the judge lays strict ground rules to prevent anyone from influencing Daniel's testimony  including bringing in a court monitor  Marge  and demanding that all conversations must be held in French  in spite of Sandra's struggles with the language.Daniel then asks that Sandra leave their house for the weekend so he can be alone with Marge and Snoop. After hearing Sandra's testimony about Samuel's aspirin overdose  Daniel has remembered that Snoop became sick at that time and now suspects that Snoop ate some of Samuel's vomit. He deliberately feeds Snoop aspirin and finds it has the same effect  which aligns with Sandra's testimony.Daniel confides to Marge his anguish over trying to determine the truth  and she advises him that sometimes when we do not know what is really true  we can instead just decide what's true for us. On the witness stand  Daniel says that if his mother did this  he cannot understand it  but if his father did it  he can. He testifies that when he and Samuel were driving Snoop to the veterinarian  his father spoke to him about the need to be prepared that those he loves will die and to know that his life will go on  which Daniel now sees as Samuel's own suicidal thoughts.Sandra is soon acquitted after Daniel's testimony. When she comes home  Daniel tells her he was afraid of her homecoming and she says that she was too; the two embrace. As Sandra heads to bed  she lingers at a photo of her and Samuel before falling asleep with Snoop.  ,nan

Outside the town  the rats are revealed to be sentient and literate  working with Keith and Maurice to defraud towns.They are heading to the town of Bad Blintz next which suffers from a lack of food and where rat catchers have been unable to find the reason of the disappearing food. Trying to infiltrate the tunnels under the city  the rats notice that there are no local rats despite traces of them. They find a trap that captures rats alive and Darktan  their leader  is trapped inside. Meanwhile  Maurice has entered the mayor's house and when Keith tries to find him  they meet the mayor's daughter  Malicia  who quickly deduces - after seeing tap-dancing rat Sardines - that they are behind the recent plague of rats in nearby towns and enlists them to help discover the reason behind the city's food shortage.Their quest leads them to the local rat catchers headquarters where they find a secret passage to the basement filled with food. Tehy also find Darktan and the other rats coming from the tunnels with the trap they found.

The rat catchers catch Sardines and use him for the ring but he is rescued by the others.Poisoning the food with laxatives  Maurice  Keith and Malicia manage to force the rat catchers to admit that they created a rat king when eight rats they left in a bucket got their tails knotted and developed an evil sentience  capable of controlling other rats.

Maurice runs into the woods to find the two humans while the rats are attempting to resist the rat king's call to merge with him. Keith and Malicia return and after some initial hurdles  he manages to play the flute correctly to beguile the rats away from the rat kings influence until only the king itself remains. The rat king uses the last of his power to freeze everyone in place but Dangerous Beans manages to break free  defying him again. The rat king then telepathically snaps his neck. Laying dying  Dangerous Beans reminds Maurice to be a cat and he uses his bottled up instincts to attack and kill the rat king  mortally wounding himself in the process. When Death and the Death of Rats arrive to take Dangerous Beans and one of Maurice lives  he successfully trades one of his lives for Dangerous Beans' life  allowing both of them to wake up.The rat king defeated and the food given back to the townspeople  the town and the rats come to an agreement.

Meanwhile  David Kane continues to seek revenge against Aquaman  and follows the research of marine scientist Stephen Shin to look for Atlantean artifacts.

Atlantis is attacked by Black Manta  who takes the kingdom's orichalcum reserves to power his ancient Atlantean machines restored by Shin  injures Mera  and proves himself capable of fighting Arthur in equal terms. Reconvening with his mother Atlanna and Mera's father Nereus  Arthur discovers that David is behind the rising temperatures  as he went after all the hidden reserves of orichalcum  which emits high quantities of greenhouse gases and nearly caused a planetary extinction when used by an ancient Atlantean kingdom.
